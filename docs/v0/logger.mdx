## AgentOps logger

The AgentsOps logger is quick and simple way of integrating your existing 
agent codebase with AgentOps. It allows you to use your current logs as events 
by extending the built-in Python logging system to emit events to AgentOps.

There are main ways of using it: 
* Initializing a new Logger with AgentOps functionality
* Adding a log handler to your existing Logger

But first, we must import AgentOps classes and initilize the AgentOps client.

```python python
from agentops import Client, AgentOpsLogger

ao_client = Client(<INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE>)
```

### Initializing a new Logger

If you don't already have a logger or want to simply initialize your logger
via AgentOps, do the following: 

We can initilize a new logger with the following:
```python python
logger = AgentOpsLogger.get_agentops_logger(ao_client, "my_logger")
```
Now whenever you call get a logger with the same name, any logs written to the 
logger will be sent to AgentOps.

`get_agentops_logger` also takes the optional parameter of `level` to limit
the amount of logs that get sent to AgentOps.

### Adding a log handler

If you already have complex set ups for your logging and you find it more convinient, 
you can get a log handler from Agent Ops and attach it to your existing logger

Then we can initilize a new logger with the client
```python python
handler = AgentOpsLogger.get_agentops_handler(agentops, "my_logger")
<YOUR LOGGER>.addHandler(handler)
```

## Details

The AgentOpsLogger class is a utility class for creating loggers 
and handlers configured to work with the AgentOps service.

```python python
@staticmethod
def get_agentops_logger(client: Client, name: str, level=logging.DEBUG)
```
This static method creates and returns a logger with an AgentOpsHandler.

Arguments

   * client (Client): The AgentOps client to which the logs will be sent.
   * name (str): The name for the logger and handler.
   * level (int, optional): The minimum severity level to log. Defaults to logging.DEBUG.

Returns
* A logger (logging.Logger) configured with an AgentOpsHandler.

```python python
@staticmethod
def get_agentops_handler(client: AgentOps, name: str)
```

This static method creates and returns an AgentOpsHandler.

Arguments
    * client (Client): The AgentOps client to which the logs will be sent.
    * name (str): The name for the handler.

Returns
* A new AgentOpsHandler with the given client and name.

The AgentOpsHandler class is a custom logging handler for sending logs 
to the AgentOps service. This handler extends the built-in logging.Handler
 class to send log records to AgentOps. It also removes ANSI color codes 
 from log messages before sending them.

This method initializes the handler with a specific AgentOps client and name.

Arguments
    * client (Client): The AgentOps client to which the logs will be sent.
    * name (str): The name for this handler.

```python python
@staticmethod
def remove_color_codes(s: str) -> str
```
This static method removes ANSI color codes from a string.

Arguments
    * s (str): The string from which color codes will be removed.

Returns
*The same string, but without any color codes.

###emit

```python python
def emit(self, record)
```
This method processes a log record and sends it to the AgentOps client. It is called whenever a log record needs to be processed.

Arguments
    * record (logging.LogRecord): The log record to process.
