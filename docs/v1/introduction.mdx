# AgentOps solves what Terminal can't

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card title="Terminal CAN'T..." icon="trash" iconType="solid" color="#d6483e">
		- • Track agents across executions
		- • Parse out LLM completions from output logs
		- • Give you insight into what your agents did
	</Card>
	<Card title="AgentOps does it all and more..." icon="face-smile-halo" iconType="regular" color="#2bd600">
		- • Record LLM prompts, completions, & timestamps
		- • Log events, calls, and any other agent activity
		- • Link agent errors back to their causal event
	</Card>
</CardGroup>

And we do it all in just two lines of code...
<CodeGroup>
	```python python
	import agentops
	agentops.init(<INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE>)
	```
</CodeGroup>
... that logs everything back to your AgentOps Dashboard.

## The AgentOps Dashboard

With just two lines of code, you can free yourself from the chains of the terminal and, instead, visualize your agents' behavior
in your AgentOps Dashboard. After setting up AgentOps, each execution of your program is recorded as a session and the above
data is automatically recorded for you.

The examples below were captured with two lines of code.

### Session Drilldown
Here you will find a list of all of your previously recorded sessions and useful data about each such as total execution time.
You also get helpful debugging info such as any SDK versions you were on if you're building on a supported agent framework like Crew or AutoGen.
LLM calls are presented as a familiar chat history view, and charts give you a breakdown of the types of events that were called and how long they took.

Find any past sessions from your Session Drawer.

Most powerful of all is the Session Waterfall. On the left, a time visualization of all your LLM calls, Action events, Tool calls, and Errors.
On the right, specific details about the event you've selected on the waterfall. For instance the exact prompt and completion for a given LLM call. 
Most of which has been automatically recorded for you.
