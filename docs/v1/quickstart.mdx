### Install the SDK

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip 
pip install agentops
```
```bash poetry
poetry add agentops
```
</CodeGroup>

### Add 2 lines of code = magically tracked LLM calls

<CodeGroup>
```python python
import openai
import agentops

# Beginning of program's code (i.e. main.py, __init__.py)

agentops.init(<INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE>)
```
</CodeGroup>

>  Explanation: When openai has been imported, instantiating the AgentOps client will automatically instrument chat completions. You will be able to see all of your sessions on the AgentOps dashboard along with the full LLM chat histories, cost, token counts, etc.


## Get an API key

Retrieve an API Key from the Settings > [Projects & API Keys](https://app.agentops.ai/settings/projects) page.

API keys are tied to individual projects.<br></br>
A Default Project has been created for you, so just click <span style={{ padding: "5px 10px", backgroundColor: "black", color: "white", borderRadius: "5px"}}>Copy API Key</span>

{/* TODO: Install Tailwind for this stuff */}

<div
  style={{ backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0", padding: "20px", borderRadius: "10px" }}
>
  <img height="200" src="/images/api-keys.png" />
</div>


## Finishing up on the basic functionality

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="code" title="Decorate Functions">
  You can instrument other functions inside your code with the handy `@record_function`
  decorator, which will record an `action_type`, the parameters, and the returns. You
  will see these function calls alongside your LLM calls from instantiating the AgentOps client.
  ```python python
  # (record specific functions)
  @agentops.record_function('sample function being record')
  def sample_function(...):
    ...
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="robot" title="Track Agents">
  If you use specific named agents within your system, you can tie all downstream [Events](/v1/details/events) to a
  Named Agent with the `@track_agent` decorator.
  ```python python
  # (track a named agent)
  @agentops.track_agent(name='my-expert-agent')
  class sample_agent(...):
    ...
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="stop" title="Ending Your Session">
  Finally, you should end your session by calling `.end_session()` with whether your session 
  was successful or not `(Success|Fail)`. We suggest setting session state depending on how 
  your agent exits or whether your agent succeeded or not. You can also specify a end state reason,
  such as user interrupted, ran to completion, or unhandled exception.
  ```python python
  # End of program
  agentops.end_session('Success')
  # Woohoo! You're done 🎉
  ```
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="browser" title="Check out your dashboard">
  Run your agent and then visit [`app.agentops.ai`](https://app.agentops.ai). 
  From the "Session Drill-Down" you should be able to see all of your OpenAI calls! 
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Code

Here is the complete code from the sections above

```python python
import openai
import agentops

# Beginning of program's code (i.e. main.py, __init__.py)
agentops.init(<INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE>)

# (record specific functions)
@agentops.record_function('sample function being record')
def sample_function(...):
  ...

# (track a named agent)
@agentops.track_agent(name='my-expert-agent')
class sample_agent(...):
  ...

# End of program
agentops.end_session('Success')
# Woohoo! You're done 🎉
```
