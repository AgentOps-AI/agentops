<CodeGroup>
```python python
import openai
import agentops

# Beginning of program's code (i.e. main.py, __init__.py)

agentops.init(<INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE>)

# Woohoo! You're on your way ðŸŽ‰

```
</CodeGroup>

When openai has been imported, instantiating the AgentOps client will automatically
instrument chat completions. You will be able to see all of your sessions on the AgentOps
dashboard along with the full LLM chat histories, cost, token counts, etc.


## Decorate Functions
  You can instrument other functions inside your code with the handy `@record_function`
  decorator, which will record an `action_type`, the parameters, and the returns. You
  will see these function calls alongside your LLM calls from instantiating the AgentOps client.
  ```python python
  # (record specific functions)
  @agentops.record_function('sample function being record')
  def sample_function(...):
    ...
```

## Track Agents
  If you use specific named agents within your system, you can tie all downstream [Events](/v1/details/events) to a
  Named Agent with the `@track_agent` decorator.
  ```python python
  # (track a named agent)
  @agentops.track_agent(name='my-expert-agent')
  class sample_agent(...):
    ...
```

## Ending Your Session

  Finally, you should end your session by calling `.end_session()` with whether your session 
  was successful or not `(Success|Fail)`. We suggest setting session state depending on how 
  your agent exits or whether your agent succeeded or not. You can also specify a end state reason,
  such as user interrupted, ran to completion, or unhandled exception.
  ```python python
  # End of program
  agentops.end_session('Success')
  # Woohoo! You're done ðŸŽ‰
  ```

## Check out your dashboard
  Run your agent and then visit [`app.agentops.ai`](https://app.agentops.ai). 
  From the "Session Drill-Down" you should be able to see all of your OpenAI calls! 

## Example Code

Here is the complete code from the sections above

```python python
import openai
import agentops

# Beginning of program's code (i.e. main.py, __init__.py)
agentops.init(<INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE>)

# (record specific functions)
@agentops.record_function('sample function being record')
def sample_function(...):
  ...

# (track a named agent)
@agentops.track_agent(name='my-expert-agent')
class sample_agent(...):
  ...

# End of program
agentops.end_session('Success')
# Woohoo! You're done ðŸŽ‰
```
