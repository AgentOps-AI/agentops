### How it works

When the AgentOps SDK detects the `openai`, `litellm`, or `cohere` as installed modules, it will automatically
start tracking their usage. No further work is required from you! ðŸ˜Š

### Not working? 

Try these steps:
1. Make sure you have the latest version of the AgentOps SDK installed. We are constantly updating it to support new LLM libraries and releases.
2. Make sure you are calling `agentops.init()` *after* importing the LLM module but *before* you are calling the LLM method.
3. Make sure the `instrument_llm_calls` parameter of `agentops.init()` is set to `True` (default).

Still not working? Please let us know! You can find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DR2abmETjZ),
