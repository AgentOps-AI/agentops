description: What are Tags and how to use them.

Tags are a fantastic way to organize your Sessions based on data known by the developer but not by AgentOps.
Ex: `paid-user`, `v3`, `recruiter-agent`

# How to use Tags

Tags belong to [Sessions](/v1/details/tags), but can be assigned in multiple ways.

## On `init()`

Passing tags into the `init` function will assign these tags to the `Session`

```python
agentops.init(tags=['test tag'])
```

## `set_tags([str])`

This will override any existing tags on the session and set them to the value passed into the function.

```python
agentops.set_tags(['test new tag'])
```

## `add_tags([str])`

This will append an array of tags to the Session's existing tags

```python
agentops.add_tags(['appended tag'])
```
