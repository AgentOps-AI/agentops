### How it works

When the AgentOps SDK detects a supported LLM provider module installed, it will automatically
start tracking its usage. No further work is required from you! ðŸ˜Š

### Not working? 

Try these steps:
1. Make sure you have the latest version of the AgentOps SDK installed. We are constantly updating it to support new LLM libraries and releases.
2. Make sure you are calling `agentops.init()` *after* importing the LLM module but *before* you are calling the LLM method.
3. Make sure the `instrument_llm_calls` parameter of `agentops.init()` is set to `True` (default).
4. Make sure if you have more than one concurrent session, you patch the LLM call as described [here](/v1/usage/multiple-sssions).

Still not working? Please let us know! You can find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DR2abmETjZ),
 [GitHub](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops), 
 or email us at [engineering@agentops.ai](mailto:engineering@agentops.ai).

To get started, just follow the quick start guide.

### Stop Tracking LLM Calls

To stop tracking LLM calls after running `agentops.init()`, you can call `agentops.stop_instrumenting()`.

This function reverts the changes made to your LLM provider's module, removing AgentOps instrumentation.

_Special consideration for Cohere: Calling `stop_instrumenting()` has no effect on previously instantiated Cohere clients. You must create a new Cohere client after calling this function._
