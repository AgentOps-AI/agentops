title: "Tracking Agents"
description: "Use the `@track_agent()` decorator to tag your agents"
---

All Events are automatically associated with the agent that originated them. Agents are given a name which is what you will see in the dashboard.

<Frame type="glass" caption="This event is labeled with the name of the Agent that originated it">
  <img height="200" src="/images/agent-name.png" />
</Frame>

The example below tags the agent MyAgent with name `SomeCustomName`.

```python python
from agentops import track_agent

@track_agent(name='SomeCustomName')
class MyAgent:
    ...
```

`trackagent.name` is optional. <br></br>
If omitted, agent name defaults to the name of the class (e.g. MyAgent). <br></br>
If an event does not originate from a tracked agent, agent name defaults to "Default Agent".
