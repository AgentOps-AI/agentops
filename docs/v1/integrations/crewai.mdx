## Overview
[CrewAI](https://crewai.io) is a framework for easily building multi-agent applications.

AgentOps and CrewAI teamed up to make monitoring Crew agents dead simple.

## Setup

> ðŸš¨ NOTE: At this time, Crew with AgentOps integration is in pre-release. In the interim, an official fork has been
made available. After official support is released, this fork will be deprecated and developers will
be encouraged to use the core Crew SDK.

**Install crew from the AgentOps Fork:**

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip 
pip install git+https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/crewAI.git@main
```
```bash poetry
poetry add git+https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/crewAI.git@main
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using Crew
Crew has comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.crewai.com) available as well as a great [Crew Quickstart](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Creating-a-Crew-and-kick-it-off/).


## Adding AgentOps to Crew agents

Create a user API key here: https://app.agentops.ai/account

Add your API key to your environment variables

```
AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>
```

Before calling the constructor `Crew()` in your script, include these lines:

```python
import agentops
agentops.init()
```
