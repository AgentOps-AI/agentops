# MetaGPT Integration

[MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT) is a multi-agent framework that simulates a software company, where different roles (Product Manager, Architect, Engineer) collaborate to build software from a simple prompt.

## Installation

```bash
pip install "metagpt==0.8.1" "openai==1.6.1" agentops
```

<Callout type="info">
MetaGPT 0.8.1 requires OpenAI SDK version 1.6.1 specifically. Using different versions may cause compatibility issues with the integration.
</Callout>

## Configuration

Add your AgentOps API key to MetaGPT's configuration file (`~/.metagpt/config2.yaml`). Use this minimal configuration:

```yaml
llm:
  api_type: "openai"
  api_key: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
  model: "gpt-4"

repair_llm_output: true
agentops_api_key: "YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY" # get key from https://app.agentops.ai/settings/projects
```

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure to replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY` with your actual API keys. Keep the configuration minimal to avoid initialization issues.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Known Limitation**: MetaGPT 0.8.1 has compatibility issues with proxy configurations. For now, ensure you're running without any proxy settings in your environment or configuration.
</Callout>

## Example: Software Company Simulation

Here's how to run a MetaGPT software company simulation with AgentOps tracking:

```python
from metagpt.software_company import generate_repo

# AgentOps tracking is automatically enabled if agentops_api_key is configured
repo = generate_repo("Create a simple calculator app")
```

## Viewing Results

After running your simulation:

1. Visit [app.agentops.ai](https://app.agentops.ai)
2. Sign in with GitHub to access your dashboard
3. Find your session tagged with "software_company"

Here's an example of a MetaGPT software company simulation tracked by AgentOps:

```text
=== MetaGPT with AgentOps Integration Example ===

Session Overview:
Duration: 1m 0.2s | Cost: $0.164820 | LLMs: 3 | Tools: 0 | Actions: 0 | Errors: 0
Session URL: https://app.agentops.ai/drilldown?session_id=ac0ea6a2-3f50-4f4b-994f-117d829a0116

Agent Interactions:
1. Product Manager (Alice) - Prepared requirements and PRD
2. Architect (Bob) - Created system design with MVC pattern
3. Project Manager (Eve) - Generated task list and dependencies

Project Outcome:
Generated calculator app with:
- main.py - Application entry point
- model.py - Calculation logic and history management
- view.py - User interface components
- controller.py - Input handling and coordination
```

The example above demonstrates how AgentOps tracks:
- Session metrics (duration, cost, LLM usage)
- Agent interactions and role assignments
- Project outcomes and deliverables

## How it Works

MetaGPT automatically integrates with AgentOps to track your software company simulations. When you run `generate_repo()`, AgentOps:

1. Initializes a new session with the "software_company" tag
2. Tracks all agent interactions throughout the simulation
3. Records the final outcome when the simulation completes

## Advanced Configuration

You can customize the AgentOps integration by modifying the tags:

```python
import agentops
from metagpt.software_company import generate_repo

# Initialize with custom tags
agentops.init(tags=["software_company", "calculator_project"])

repo = generate_repo("Create a simple calculator app")
```
