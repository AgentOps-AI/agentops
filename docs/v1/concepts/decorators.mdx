> Decorators work by wrapping functions or classes that they are placed above. You've probably seen this before.
> Using decorators allows us to add a lot of functionality to your code with minimal work on your part.

> @example_decorator()
> def hello_world():

## `@track_agent()`
If your implementation uses Classes to denote Agents, this decorator enables automatic agent tracking.

Learn more about tracking agents [here](/v1/usage/tracking-agents).

## `@track_function()`
Sometimes your agent system will use functions that are important to track as [`Actions`](/v1/concepts/events/#actionevent).

Adding this decorator above any function will allow every instance of that function call to be tracked and displayed
in your [Session](v1/concepts/sessions) Drill-Down on the dashboard.
