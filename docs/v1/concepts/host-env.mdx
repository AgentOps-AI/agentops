## What Data is Collected?

The AgentOps SDK uses `psutil` to gather certain information about the machine that it is being run on. This data
includes information about:
- CPU
- Memory
- Storage
- Operating System

## How is it used?

This data is used only for determining issues with the host environment and reporting this on your dashboard.

> Example: Your agent performed slower because of a reduction in available memory

This data is used in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://app.agentops.ai/privacy-policy)
and is never sold or shared.

## Opting-Out

AgentOps users can opt out of certain environment data collection by setting the following environment variable.

```
