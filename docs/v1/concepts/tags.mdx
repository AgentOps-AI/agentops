# How to use Tags

Tags belong to [Sessions](/v1/concepts/sessions) and are a fantastic way to organize your Sessions.
## On `init()`

Passing `tags` into the `init` function will assign these tags to the all subsequent Sessions.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
agentops.init(tags=['test tag'])
```
</CodeGroup>

`tags` can also be passed into the `start_session` function for better organization.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
agentops.start_session(tags=['test tag'])
```
</CodeGroup>
