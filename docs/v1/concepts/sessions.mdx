title: Sessions
description: Detailed breakdown of initializing AgentOps and managing sessions.
---

A **Session** encapsulates a singular execution instance of your workflow, bringing together all agents, LLMs, 
actions, etc., under one umbrella. Consequently, it is imperative for each event to be associated with a session. 
The AgentOps dashboard provides detailed insights at the session level, including costs, token counts, errors, and more.

**There must be an active session in order to use AgentOps.**

Only one session can be active a single time.

## `Session`

#### Properties

Sessions possess the following attributes:
- **ID**: A unique identifier for the session.
- **Project ID**: Identifies the project associated with the session, determined by the API Key used.
- **Starting Timestamp**: Marks the beginning of the session.
- **Ending Timestamp**: Indicates when the session concludes.
- **End State**: Signifies the success or failure of the session.

Optionally, sessions may include:
- **End State Reason**: Explains why the session ended, whether due to an error or a user-triggered interrupt (SIGINT).
- **Tags**: Tags allow for the categorization and later retrieval of sessions.
- **Host Environment**: Automatically gathers basic information about the system on which the session ran.
- **Video**: If applicable, an optional video recording of the session.

## Starting a Session
When you call `agentops.init()`, a session is automatically started.
Calling `agentops.init(auto_start_session=False)` will initialize the AgentOps SDK but not start a session.

To start a session later, call `agentops.start_session()` [(reference)](/v1/usage/sdk-reference/#start-session)

## Ending a Session
If a process ends without any call to agentops, it will show in the dashboard as `Indeterminate`.
To end with a state, call `agentops.end_session()` [(reference)](/v1/usage/sdk-reference/#end-session)

## Inherited Sessions
When working with multiple agents running in different processes, it's possible to initialize AgentOps or start a session
with an existing session_id.

`agentops.init(inherited_session_id=<id>)`
`agentops.start_session(inherited_session_id=<id>)`

You can retrieve the current session_id by assigning the returned value from `init()` or `start_session()`

<CodeGroup>
```python python
import agentops
session_id = agentops.init()
# pass session_id to the other process

# -- other process --
session_id = retrieve_session_id()
agentops.init(inherited_session_id=<id>)
```
</CodeGroup>

Both processes will now contribute data to the same session.

## The AgentOps SDK Client
_More info for the curious_

Under the hood, `agentops.init()` sets up a `Client` object with various configuration options like your API key, worker thread options
for when to send out batches of events, etc. Whenever you start a new session, these configuration options will automatically
be applied. You can also apply different configuration options when you start a new session by passing in a
[Configuration](/v1/usage/sdk-reference/#configuration) object.
