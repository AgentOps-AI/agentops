## Event Class

The Event class is an abstract base class for events that will be recorded. It should not be instantiated directly.

| Parameter      | Type | Default                      | Example                              | Description                                                 |
| -------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| params         | dict | None                         | `{"param1": "value1"}`               | Additional parameters for the event                         |
| returns        | str  | None                         | "Success"                            | Return value of the event                                   |
| init_timestamp | str  | A timestamp of instantiation | "2023-03-15T18:59:13Z"               | The time when the Event was initiated                       |
| end_timestamp  | str  | A timestamp of instantiation | "2023-03-15T19:00:13Z"               | The time when the Event was completed                       |
| agent_id       | UUID | UUID of the triggering agent | 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 | The unique identifier of the agent that triggered the event |
| id             | UUID | A new UUID                   | 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614170000 | The unique identifier of the event                          |

## ActionEvent

The `ActionEvent` is a generic event for recording events that do not fit into the bounds of a more specific Event type.

| Parameter   | Type | Default | Example                        | Description                                         |
| ----------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| action_type | str  | None    | "Click"                        | Type of the action                                  |
| logs        | str  | None    | "Executed action successfully" | Logs generated during the action event              |
| screenshot  | str  | None    | "/path/to/screenshot.png"      | Path to screenshot captured during the action event |

An action event can be used the [same way as other events](/v1/usage/recording-events) but also with the `record_function`
decorator.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
from agentops import record_function

@record_function()
def some_action(params):
    return "some response"
```
</CodeGroup>

This decorator will record an `ActionEvent` with the params and returns of the function as well as execution time.

## LLMEvent

The LLMEvent class is for recording calls to LLMs. AgentOps auto-instruments calls to the most popular LLMs e.g. GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.

_In most cases, `LLMEvent` should not be used by the developer. These are created automatically._

| Parameter         | Type          | Default | Example                              | Description                    |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| thread_id         | UUID          | None    | 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 | Thread ID of the event         |
| prompt            | str or List   | None    | "What's the weather today?"          | The prompt for the event       |
| prompt_tokens     | int           | None    | 5                                    | Number of tokens in the prompt |
| completion        | str or object | None    | "It's sunny and warm."               | The completion of the event    |
| completion_tokens | int           | None    | 4                                    | Number of tokens in completion |
| model             | Models or str | None    | Models.MODEL_NAME or "model_name"    | The model used for the event   |

## ToolEvent

The ToolEvent class is for recording calls to tools e.g. searchWeb, fetchFromDB.

| Parameter | Type        | Default | Example                                                 | Description                  |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| name      | str         | None    | "Parsing Tool"                                          | Name of the tool             |
| logs      | str or dict | None    | "Tool executed successfully" or `{"status": "success"}` | Logs from the tool execution |

The tool event should be created previous to running the tool in order to track the execution time.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
from agentops import ToolEvent, record
def scrape_website(url: str):
    tool_event = ToolEvent(name='scrape_website', params={'url':url}) # the start timestamp is set when the obj is created
    result = integration.scrape_website(data) # perform tool logic
    tool_event.returns = result # set result
    record(tool_event)
```
</CodeGroup>

## ErrorEvent

Error events can be used alone or in reference to another event. The can reference errors that the LLM made or errors
in execution, up to the developer.

| Parameter     | Type  | Default                                          | Example                     | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| trigger_event | Event | None                                             | Event instance              | The Event that triggered the ErrorEvent   |
| error_type    | str   | None                                             | "Runtime Error"             | Type of the error                         |
| code          | str   | None                                             | "ERR001"                    | Code of the error                         |
| details       | str   | None                                             | "Null pointer exception"    | Detailed description of the error         |
| logs          | str   | None                                             | "Error occurred at line 10" | Logs related to the error                 |
| timestamp     | str   | A timestamp when the ErrorEvent was instantiated | "2023-03-15T18:59:13Z"      | Timestamp when the ErrorEvent was created |

<CodeGroup>
```python python
from agentops import ToolEvent, record, ErrorEvent
def scrape_website(url: str):
    tool_event = ToolEvent(name='scrape_website', params={'url':url}) # the start timestamp is set when the obj is created
    try:
        result = integration.scrape_website(data) # perform tool logic
        tool_event.returns = result
    except Error as e:
        record(ErrorEvent(message=e, trigger_event=tool_event))
    record(tool_event)
```
</CodeGroup>
