# Agno Framework Comprehensive Tutorial with AgentOps

This tutorial demonstrates the powerful capabilities of the Agno framework for building AI agents and teams. Agno provides a flexible and intuitive way to create intelligent agents that can collaborate, use tools, and perform complex tasks.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Basic Agents and Teams** - Creating individual agents and coordinating them in teams
2. **Tool Integration with RAG** - Integrating tools and knowledge bases for enhanced capabilities
3. **Workflows with Caching** - Building efficient workflows with state management
4. **Collaborative Research Teams** - Creating specialized agents that work together
5. **Async Operations** - Running agents asynchronously for better performance

Throughout this tutorial, AgentOps will track all agent activities, providing detailed insights into your AI system's behavior.
## Getting Started

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment. We'll need Agno for building agents and AgentOps for monitoring and tracking.


```python
import os
import asyncio
from typing import Iterator
from textwrap import dedent
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```


```python
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
```
## Environment Setup

Now we'll load environment variables and import the Agno framework components. The order of imports is important - we import agno first to ensure proper instrumentation, then import specific classes we'll use.


```python
# Now import agno to trigger instrumentation, then import specific classes
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse 
from agno.team import Team  
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat  
from agno.workflow import Workflow  
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools 
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools 
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools  
from agno.tools.arxiv import ArxivTools  
from agno.tools.googlesearch import GoogleSearchTools  
from agno.knowledge.url import UrlKnowledge  
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response 
from agno.utils.log import logger  
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb  
from agno.vectordb.search import SearchType  
from agno.embedder.cohere import CohereEmbedder 
from agno.reranker.cohere import CohereReranker
import agentops  
  
```
## Initialize AgentOps

Let's initialize AgentOps to start tracking our agent activities. Make sure you have your AGENTOPS_API_KEY set in your environment variables.


```python
agentops.init(api_key=os.getenv("AGENTOPS_API_KEY"))
# Sample configuration
MODEL_ID = "gpt-4o-mini"
```


```python
def check_environment():
    """Check if required environment variables are set."""
    required_vars = ["AGENTOPS_API_KEY", "OPENAI_API_KEY"]
    missing_vars = [var for var in required_vars if not os.getenv(var)]

    if missing_vars:
        print(f"Missing required environment variables: {missing_vars}")
        print("Please set these in your .env file or environment")
        return False

    print("Environment variables checked successfully")
    return True
```
## 1. Basic Agents and Teams

Let's start with the fundamentals - creating individual agents and organizing them into teams. In Agno, agents are AI-powered entities with specific roles, and teams coordinate multiple agents to accomplish complex tasks.

### Key Concepts:
- **Agent**: An individual AI entity with a specific role and model
- **Team**: A group of agents that can work together in different modes
- **Coordination Mode**: How agents interact (e.g., 'coordinate' mode)


```python
def demonstrate_basic_agents():
    """Demonstrate basic agent creation and team coordination."""
    print("\n" + "=" * 60)
    print("BASIC AGENTS AND TEAMS")
    print("=" * 60)

    try:
        # Create individual agents
        news_agent = Agent(name="News Agent", role="Get the latest news", model=OpenAIChat(id=MODEL_ID))

        weather_agent = Agent(
            name="Weather Agent", role="Get the weather for the next 7 days", model=OpenAIChat(id=MODEL_ID)
        )

        # Create a team with coordination mode
        team = Team(name="News and Weather Team", mode="coordinate", members=[news_agent, weather_agent])

        # Run team task
        response = team.run("What is the weather in Tokyo?")
        print(f"Team Response: {response.content}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Basic agents error: {e}")
```
## 2. Tool Integration with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

One of Agno's most powerful features is the ability to integrate tools and knowledge bases. This example shows how to create an agent with:
- **Knowledge Base**: Using URLs as sources of information
- **Vector Database**: LanceDB for efficient similarity search
- **Embeddings**: Cohere embeddings for semantic understanding
- **Reranking**: Improving search results with Cohere reranker
- **Reasoning Tools**: Adding logical reasoning capabilities

This creates an agent that can search through documentation and provide informed answers with sources.


```python
def demonstrate_tool_integration():
    """Demonstrate tool integration with RAG and knowledge base."""
    print("\n" + "=" * 60)
    print("TOOL INTEGRATION WITH RAG")
    print("=" * 60)

    try:
        # Create knowledge base with vector database
        knowledge_base = UrlKnowledge(
            urls=["https://docs.agno.com/introduction/agents.md"],
            # Use LanceDB as the vector database, store embeddings in the `agno_docs` table
            vector_db=LanceDb(
                uri="tmp/lancedb",
                table_name="agno_docs",
                search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
                embedder=CohereEmbedder(id="embed-v4.0"),  # noqa: E821
                reranker=CohereReranker(model="rerank-v3.5"),  # noqa: E821
            ),  # noqa: E821
        )

        # Create agent with knowledge and reasoning tools
        agent = Agent(
            model=OpenAIChat(id=MODEL_ID),
            # Agentic RAG is enabled by default when `knowledge` is provided to the Agent.
            knowledge=knowledge_base,
            # search_knowledge=True gives the Agent the ability to search on demand
            search_knowledge=True,
            tools=[ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True)],
            instructions=[
                "Include sources in your response.",
                "Always search your knowledge before answering the question.",
                "Only include the output in your response. No other text.",
            ],
            markdown=True,
        )

        print("Running RAG agent with knowledge base...")
        agent.print_response(
            "What are Agents?",
            show_full_reasoning=True,
        )

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Tool integration error: {e}")
```
## 3. Workflows with Caching

Workflows in Agno allow you to create reusable, stateful processes. This example demonstrates a caching workflow that:
- Stores previous responses in session state
- Checks cache before running expensive operations
- Yields responses in a streaming fashion
- Improves performance by avoiding redundant computations

This is particularly useful for applications where users might ask similar questions repeatedly.


```python
class CacheWorkflow(Workflow):
    """A workflow that demonstrates caching capabilities."""

    # Purely descriptive, not used by the workflow
    description: str = "A workflow that caches previous outputs"

    # Add agents or teams as attributes on the workflow
    agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=MODEL_ID))

    # Write the logic in the `run()` method
    def run(self, message: str) -> Iterator[RunResponse]:
        logger.info(f"Checking cache for '{message}'")
        # Check if the output is already cached
        if self.session_state.get(message):
            logger.info(f"Cache hit for '{message}'")
            yield RunResponse(run_id=self.run_id, content=self.session_state.get(message))
            return

        logger.info(f"Cache miss for '{message}'")
        # Run the agent and yield the response
        yield from self.agent.run(message, stream=True)

        # Cache the output after response is yielded
        self.session_state[message] = self.agent.run_response.content
```


```python
def demonstrate_workflows():
    """Demonstrate workflow capabilities with caching."""
    print("\n" + "=" * 60)
    print("WORKFLOWS WITH CACHING")
    print("=" * 60)

    try:
        workflow = CacheWorkflow()

        print("First run (cache miss):")
        # Run workflow (this takes ~1s)
        response: Iterator[RunResponse] = workflow.run(message="Tell me a joke.")
        # Print the response
        pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True, show_time=True)

        print("\nSecond run (cache hit):")
        # Run workflow again (this is immediate because of caching)
        response: Iterator[RunResponse] = workflow.run(message="Tell me a joke.")
        # Print the response
        pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True, show_time=True)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Workflow error: {e}")
```
## 4. Collaborative Research Teams

This is where Agno truly shines - creating teams of specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. In this example, we create:

### Specialized Agents:
- **Reddit Researcher**: Searches Reddit for community discussions
- **HackerNews Researcher**: Finds technical discussions on HackerNews
- **Academic Paper Researcher**: Searches scholarly articles and papers
- **Twitter Researcher**: Tracks real-time discussions and trends

### Team Configuration:
- **Collaborate Mode**: Agents work together and discuss findings
- **Discussion Master**: The team lead that manages the conversation
- **Success Criteria**: Defines when the team has reached consensus
- **Agentic Context**: Agents maintain context throughout the discussion

This demonstrates how multiple AI agents can work together like a human research team!


```python
def demonstrate_research_team():
    """Demonstrate collaborative research team with multiple specialized agents."""
    print("\n" + "=" * 60)
    print("COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH TEAM")
    print("=" * 60)

    try:
        # Create specialized research agents
        reddit_researcher = Agent(
            name="Reddit Researcher",
            role="Research a topic on Reddit",
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
            tools=[GoogleSearchTools()],
            add_name_to_instructions=True,
            instructions=dedent(
                """
                You are a Reddit researcher.
                You will be given a topic to research on Reddit.
                You will need to find the most relevant posts on Reddit.
            """
            ),
        )

        hackernews_researcher = Agent(
            name="HackerNews Researcher",
            model=OpenAIChat("gpt-4o"),
            role="Research a topic on HackerNews.",
            tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
            add_name_to_instructions=True,
            instructions=dedent(
                """
                You are a HackerNews researcher.
                You will be given a topic to research on HackerNews.

            """
            ),
        )

        academic_paper_researcher = Agent(
            name="Academic Paper Researcher",
            model=OpenAIChat("gpt-4o"),
            role="Research academic papers and scholarly content",
            tools=[GoogleSearchTools(), ArxivTools()],
            add_name_to_instructions=True,
            instructions=dedent(
                """
                You are an academic paper researcher.

            """
            ),
        )

        twitter_researcher = Agent(
            name="Twitter Researcher",
            model=OpenAIChat("gpt-4o"),
            role="Research trending discussions and real-time updates",
            tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],

            stream_intermediate_steps=True,
        )

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Research team error: {e}")
```
## 5. Async Operations

Modern applications often need to run multiple AI tasks concurrently. Agno supports async operations out of the box, allowing you to:
- Run multiple agent tasks in parallel
- Improve response times for complex queries
- Handle multiple user requests simultaneously
- Build scalable AI applications

This example shows how to run three different agent tasks concurrently using Python's asyncio.


```python
async def demonstrate_async_operations():
    """Demonstrate async operations with Agno agents."""
    print("\n" + "=" * 60)
    print("ASYNC OPERATIONS")
    print("=" * 60)

    try:
        # Create async tasks with different agents
        agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=MODEL_ID))

        # Define async tasks
        async def task1():
            response = await agent.arun("Explain Python in one paragraph")
            return f"Task 1: {response.content}"

        async def task2():
            response = await agent.arun("Explain JavaScript in one paragraph")
            return f"Task 2: {response.content}"

        async def task3():
            response = await agent.arun("Compare them briefly")
            return f"Task 3: {response.content}"

        # Run tasks concurrently
        print("Running async tasks concurrently...")
        results = await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2(), task3())

        for result in results:
            print(result)
            print()

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Async operations error: {e}")
```
