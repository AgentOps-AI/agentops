# Airline Customer Service Agent with OpenAI Agents SDK

This is a simple chatbot designed to assist airline customers with common queries. Here the agents are also used as tools to help the bot answer questions more effectively.

Using AgentOps we can track the flow of the conversation and the agents used. This is useful for debugging and understanding how the bot is performing.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, you'll need:

1. **AgentOps Account**: Create a free account at [app.agentops.ai](https://app.agentops.ai)
2. **AgentOps API Key**: Obtain your API key from your AgentOps dashboard
3. **OpenAI API Key**: Get your API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)

Make sure to set these as environment variables or create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```
AGENTOPS_API_KEY=your_agentops_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Installation
Install required packages:
<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pip
  pip install agentops openai-agents python-dotenv
  ```
  ```bash poetry
  poetry add agentops openai-agents python-dotenv
  ```
  ```bash uv
  uv add agentops openai-agents python-dotenv
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup
Set the API keys for your AgentOps and OpenAI accounts.
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

os.environ["AGENTOPS_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("AGENTOPS_API_KEY", "your_agentops_api_key_here")
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "your_openai_api_key_here")
```

Initialize AgentOps:
```python
import agentops
# auto_start_session is False, so we'll start a trace manually later
agentops.init(tags=["customer-service-agent", "openai-agents", "agentops-example"], auto_start_session=False) 
```

Import necessary components from `openai-agents`:
```python
from __future__ import annotations as _annotations

import asyncio
import random
import uuid
import sys # sys import was in notebook, keeping for consistency

from pydantic import BaseModel

from agents import (
    Agent,
    HandoffOutputItem,
    ItemHelpers,
    MessageOutputItem,
    RunContextWrapper,
    Runner,
    ToolCallItem,
    ToolCallOutputItem,
    TResponseInputItem,
    function_tool,
    handoff,
    trace,
)
from agents.extensions.handoff_prompt import RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX

# Start AgentOps trace for this specific workflow
tracer = agentops.start_trace(trace_name="Customer Service Agent") # Matched notebook
```

### CONTEXT
```python
class AirlineAgentContext(BaseModel):
    passenger_name: str | None = None
    confirmation_number: str | None = None
    seat_number: str | None = None
    flight_number: str | None = None
```

### TOOLS
```python
@function_tool(
    name_override="faq_lookup_tool", description_override="Lookup frequently asked questions."
)
async def faq_lookup_tool(question: str) -> str:
    if "bag" in question or "baggage" in question:
        return (
            "You are allowed to bring one bag on the plane. "
            "It must be under 50 pounds and 22 inches x 14 inches x 9 inches."
        )
    elif "seats" in question or "plane" in question:
        return (
            "There are 120 seats on the plane. "
            "There are 22 business class seats and 98 economy seats. "
            "Exit rows are rows 4 and 16. "
            "Rows 5-8 are Economy Plus, with extra legroom. "
        )
    elif "wifi" in question:
        return "We have free wifi on the plane, join Airline-Wifi"
    return "I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to that question."


@function_tool
async def update_seat(
    context: RunContextWrapper[AirlineAgentContext], confirmation_number: str, new_seat: str
) -> str:
    """
    Update the seat for a given confirmation number.

    Args:
        confirmation_number: The confirmation number for the flight.
        new_seat: The new seat to update to.
    """
    # Update the context based on the customer's input
    context.context.confirmation_number = confirmation_number
    context.context.seat_number = new_seat
    # Ensure that the flight number has been set by the incoming handoff
    assert context.context.flight_number is not None, "Flight number is required"
    return f"Updated seat to {new_seat} for confirmation number {confirmation_number}"
```

### HOOKS
```python
async def on_seat_booking_handoff(context: RunContextWrapper[AirlineAgentContext]) -> None:
    flight_number = f"FLT-{random.randint(100, 999)}"
    context.context.flight_number = flight_number
```

### AGENTS
```python
faq_agent = Agent[AirlineAgentContext](
    name="FAQ Agent",
    handoff_description="A helpful agent that can answer questions about the airline.",
    instructions=f\"\"\"{RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX}
    You are an FAQ agent. If you are speaking to a customer, you probably were transferred to from the triage agent.
    Use the following routine to support the customer.
    # Routine
    1. Identify the last question asked by the customer.
    2. Use the faq lookup tool to answer the question. Do not rely on your own knowledge.
    3. If you cannot answer the question, transfer back to the triage agent.\"\"\",
    tools=[faq_lookup_tool],

seat_booking_agent = Agent[AirlineAgentContext](

    You are a seat booking agent. If you are speaking to a customer, you probably were transferred to from the triage agent.
    Use the following routine to support the customer.
    # Routine
    1. Ask for their confirmation number.
    2. Ask the customer what their desired seat number is.
    3. Use the update seat tool to update the seat on the flight.
    If the customer asks a question that is not related to the routine, transfer back to the triage agent. \"\"\",
    tools=[update_seat],
)

triage_agent = Agent[AirlineAgentContext](
    name="Triage Agent",
    handoff_description="A triage agent that can delegate a customer's request to the appropriate agent.",
    instructions=(

    ),
    handoffs=[
        faq_agent,
        handoff(agent=seat_booking_agent, on_handoff=on_seat_booking_handoff),
    ],
)

faq_agent.handoffs.append(triage_agent)
seat_booking_agent.handoffs.append(triage_agent)
```

### RUN
```python
async def main():
    current_agent: Agent[AirlineAgentContext] = triage_agent
    input_items: list[TResponseInputItem] = []
    context = AirlineAgentContext()

    # Normally, each input from the user would be an API request to your app, and you can wrap the request in a trace()
    # Here, we'll just use a random UUID for the conversation ID
    conversation_id = uuid.uuid4().hex[:16]

    # Simulate a few turns for the MDX example
    simulated_inputs = [
        "What are the baggage rules?",
        "I want to change my seat.",
        "My confirmation is 123XYZ",
        "I want seat 10A",
        "Thanks!"
    ]
    
    for user_input in simulated_inputs:
        print(f"User: {user_input}") 
        # In a real app, you'd get input: user_input = input("Enter your message: ")
        with trace("Customer service", group_id=conversation_id): # Notebook uses "Customer service"
            input_items.append({"content": user_input, "role": "user"})
            result = await Runner.run(current_agent, input_items, context=context)

            for new_item in result.new_items:
                agent_name = new_item.agent.name
                if isinstance(new_item, MessageOutputItem):
                    print(f"{agent_name}: {ItemHelpers.text_message_output(new_item)}")
                elif isinstance(new_item, HandoffOutputItem):
                    print(
                        f"Handed off from {new_item.source_agent.name} to {new_item.target_agent.name}" # Matched notebook
                    )
                elif isinstance(new_item, ToolCallItem):
                    print(f"{agent_name}: Calling a tool") # Matched notebook
                elif isinstance(new_item, ToolCallOutputItem):
                    print(f"{agent_name}: Tool call output: {new_item.output}")
                else:
                    print(f"{agent_name}: Skipping item: {new_item.__class__.__name__}") # Matched notebook
            input_items = result.to_input_list()
            current_agent = result.last_agent
        if user_input.lower() == "thanks!": # End simulation
            break
    
    agentops.end_trace(tracer, end_state="Success") # MDX was correct with end_state


# To run in a Jupyter notebook or a script that can handle asyncio:
# await main() 
# For MDX, we'll just define it. To run, you'd typically use:
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     asyncio.run(main())
```
To run this example, save it as a Python file and execute it. You will be prompted for user input in the console.
