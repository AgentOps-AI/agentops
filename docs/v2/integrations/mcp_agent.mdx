title: MCP Agent
---

MCP Agent (lastmile-ai/mcp-agent) is now auto-instrumented by AgentOps.

- No code changes needed. Ensure AgentOps is initialized in your app so OpenTelemetry spans export to AgentOps.
- When `mcp-agent` is installed and imported as `mcp_agent`, AgentOps will activate the `McpAgentInstrumentor` and suppress duplicate provider instrumentation.

Quick start:

```python
import agentops

agentops.init("<AGENTOPS_API_KEY>")

# Import and use mcp_agent normally
from mcp_agent.app import MCPApp

# ... your app code ...

agentops.end_session("Success")
```

Requirements:

- `mcp-agent >= 0.1.0`
- AgentOps Python SDK installed (`pip install agentops`)

Notes:

- MCP Agent already emits OpenTelemetry spans via its telemetry manager; AgentOps will route them to your project with proper resource attributes and JWT-auth OTLP exporter.
