[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) is a framework for easily building multi-agent applications. AgentOps integrates with CrewAI to provide observability into your agent workflows. Crew has comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.crewai.com) available as well as a great [quickstart](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Creating-a-Crew-and-kick-it-off/) guide.

## Installation
Install AgentOps and CrewAI, along with `python-dotenv` for managing API keys:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pip
  pip install agentops crewai python-dotenv
  ```
  ```bash poetry
  poetry add agentops crewai python-dotenv
  ```
  ```bash uv
  uv add agentops crewai python-dotenv
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Setting Up API Keys

You'll need API keys for AgentOps and OpenAI (since `ChatOpenAI` is commonly used with CrewAI):
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: From the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **AGENTOPS_API_KEY**: From your [AgentOps Dashboard](https://app.agentops.ai/)

Set these as environment variables or in a `.env` file.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Export to CLI
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
  export AGENTOPS_API_KEY="your_agentops_api_key_here"
  ```
  ```txt Set in .env file
  OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
  AGENTOPS_API_KEY="your_agentops_api_key_here"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Then load them in your Python code:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

AGENTOPS_API_KEY = os.getenv("AGENTOPS_API_KEY")
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

## Usage

Simply initialize AgentOps at the beginning of your CrewAI application. AgentOps will automatically instrument CrewAI and LangChain components (like `ChatOpenAI`) to track your agent interactions.

Here's how to set up a basic CrewAI application with AgentOps:

```python
import agentops
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize AgentOps client
agentops.init()

# Define the LLM to use with CrewAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4", # Or your preferred model
    temperature=0.7
)

# Create an agent
researcher = Agent(
    role='Researcher',
    goal='Research and provide accurate information about cities and their history',
    backstory='You are an expert researcher with vast knowledge of world geography and history.',
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True
)

# Create a task
research_task = Task(
    description='What is the capital of France? Provide a detailed answer about its history, culture, and significance.',
    expected_output='A comprehensive response about Paris, including its status as the capital of France, historical significance, cultural importance, and key landmarks.',
    agent=researcher
)

# Create a crew with the researcher
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task],
    verbose=True
)

# Execute the task
result = crew.kickoff()

print("\nCrew Research Results:")
print(result)
```
