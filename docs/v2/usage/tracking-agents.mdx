AgentOps automatically tracks LLM interactions in your application. For more detailed tracking, especially in multi-agent systems, you can use additional features to associate operations with specific agents.

## Basic Agent Tracking

For simple applications, AgentOps will automatically track your LLM calls without additional configuration:

```python
import agentops
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize AgentOps
agentops.init("your-api-key")

# Create a simple agent function
def research_agent(query):
    client = OpenAI()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Research about: {query}"}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Use your agent - all LLM calls will be tracked automatically
result = research_agent("quantum computing")
```

## Advanced: Using the Agent Decorator

For more structured tracking in complex applications, you can use the `@agent` decorator to explicitly identify different agents in your system:

```python
import agentops
from agentops.sdk.decorators import agent, operation, trace
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize AgentOps
agentops.init("your-api-key", auto_start_session=False)

# Create a decorated agent class
@agent(name='ResearchAgent')
class MyAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = OpenAI()
        
    @operation
    def search(self, query):
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Research about: {query}"}]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content

# Create a trace to group the agent operations
@trace(name="research-workflow")
def research_workflow(topic):
    agent = MyAgent()
    result = agent.search(topic)
    return result

# Execute the function to properly register the agent span
result = research_workflow("quantum computing")
```

If you don't specify a name, the agent will use the class name by default:

```python
@agent
class ResearchAgent:
    # This agent will have the name "ResearchAgent"
    pass
```

## Multi-Agent Systems

For complex multi-agent systems, you can organize multiple agents within a single trace:

```python
from agentops.sdk.decorators import agent, operation, tool, trace

@agent
class DataCollectionAgent:
    @tool(cost=0.02)
    def fetch_data(self, source):
        return f"Data from {source}"

@agent  
class AnalysisAgent:
    @operation
    def analyze_data(self, data):
        return f"Analysis of {data}"

@agent
class ReportingAgent:
    @tool(cost=0.01)
    def generate_report(self, analysis):
        return f"Report: {analysis}"

@trace(name="multi-agent-workflow")
def collaborative_workflow(data_source):
    """Workflow using multiple specialized agents"""
    
    # Data collection
    collector = DataCollectionAgent()
    raw_data = collector.fetch_data(data_source)
    
    # Analysis
    analyzer = AnalysisAgent()
    analysis = analyzer.analyze_data(raw_data)
    
    # Reporting
    reporter = ReportingAgent()
    report = reporter.generate_report(analysis)
    
    return {
        "source": data_source,
        "analysis": analysis,
        "report": report
    }

# Run the collaborative workflow
result = collaborative_workflow("customer_database")
```

## Agent Communication and Coordination

You can track complex agent interactions and communication patterns:

```python
from agentops.sdk.decorators import agent, operation, tool, trace

@agent
class CoordinatorAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_queue = []
    
    @operation
    def assign_task(self, task, agent_type):
        self.task_queue.append({"task": task, "agent": agent_type})
        return f"Task assigned to {agent_type}: {task}"
    
    @operation
    def collect_results(self, results):
        return f"Collected {len(results)} results"

@agent
class WorkerAgent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
    
    @tool(cost=0.05)
    def process_task(self, task):
        return f"Agent {self.agent_id} processed: {task}"

@trace(name="coordinated-processing")
def coordinated_processing_workflow(tasks):
    """Workflow with agent coordination"""
    coordinator = CoordinatorAgent()
    workers = [WorkerAgent(f"worker_{i}") for i in range(3)]
    
    # Assign tasks
    assignments = []
    for i, task in enumerate(tasks):
        worker_type = f"worker_{i % len(workers)}"
        assignment = coordinator.assign_task(task, worker_type)
        assignments.append(assignment)
    
    # Process tasks
    results = []
    for i, task in enumerate(tasks):
        worker = workers[i % len(workers)]
        result = worker.process_task(task)
        results.append(result)
    
    # Collect results
    summary = coordinator.collect_results(results)
    
    return {
        "assignments": assignments,
        "results": results,
        "summary": summary
    }

# Run coordinated workflow
tasks = ["analyze_data", "generate_report", "send_notification"]
result = coordinated_processing_workflow(tasks)
```

## Dashboard Visualization

All operations are automatically associated with the agent that originated them. Agents are given a name which is what you will see in the dashboard.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: For most applications, just using `agentops.init()` is sufficient.

2. **Use Decorators When Needed**: Add the `@agent` decorator when you need to clearly distinguish between multiple agents in your system.

3. **Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive names for your agents to make them easier to identify in the dashboard.

4. **Organize with Traces**: Use the `@trace` decorator to group related agent operations into logical workflows.

5. **Track Costs**: Use the `@tool` decorator with cost parameters to track the expenses associated with agent operations.

6. **Agent Specialization**: Create specialized agents for different types of tasks to improve observability and maintainability.

## Migration from Session Decorator

If you're migrating from the legacy `@session` decorator, replace it with the `@trace` decorator:

```python
# Old approach (deprecated)
from agentops.sdk.decorators import session, agent

@session
def my_workflow():
    # workflow code
    pass

# New approach (recommended)
from agentops.sdk.decorators import trace, agent

@trace(name="my-workflow")
def my_workflow():
    # workflow code
    pass
```

The `@trace` decorator provides the same functionality as the legacy `@session` decorator but with more flexibility and better integration with the new trace management features.
