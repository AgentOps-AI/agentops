# MCP Docs Server

The Mintlify MCP Docs Server provides direct access to AgentOps's documentation and examples in Cursor, Windsurf, VSCode, Zed, Claude Code, or any other IDE or tool that supports MCP.

The MCP server tools have been designed to allow an agent to query the specific information it needs to complete an AgentOps related task - for example: implementing agent observability, integrating with different LLM providers, understanding trace concepts, and troubleshooting issues.

## How it works

Once it's installed in your IDE you can write prompts and assume the agent will understand everything about AgentOps.

### Add features

- "Add AgentOps observability to my LangChain agent"
- "Implement custom trace decorators with the @trace decorator"
- "Add tool tracking with cost metrics using the @tool decorator"

### Ask about integrations

- "How do I integrate AgentOps with OpenAI's new Agents SDK? Show me a working example"
- "Does AgentOps support CrewAI? How do I set up the integration?"
- "Can I use AgentOps with Anthropic Claude? Show me how to configure it"

### Debug or update existing code

- "My traces aren't showing up in the dashboard, what could be wrong?"
- "How do I add custom metadata to my traces?"
- "I need to track multiple agents in my system, show me how to use the @agent decorator"

And more - if you have a question, try asking your IDE and let it look it up for you.

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quick Install">
    The easiest way to install the AgentOps MCP Docs Server is using the Mintlify CLI:
    
    ```bash
    npx mint-mcp add agentops
    ```
    
    This command will automatically add the MCP server to your IDE's configuration.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual Configuration">
    If you prefer manual setup or the automatic installation doesn't work, you can add the configuration manually:
    
    ### For Claude Desktop
    
    Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:
    - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "agentops-docs": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["@mintlify/mcp", "agentops"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### For VSCode with Continue
    
    Add to your Continue configuration:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "agentops-docs": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["@mintlify/mcp", "agentops"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Issues

### Server Not Starting

- **Ensure npx is installed and working**: Try running `npx --version` in your terminal
- **Check for conflicting MCP servers**: Make sure there are no duplicate server names in your configuration
- **Verify your configuration file syntax**: Ensure the JSON is valid (no trailing commas, proper quotes)
- **On Windows**: Make sure NPM is installed properly. You can install Node.js (which includes NPM) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

### Tool Calls Failing

- **Restart the MCP server and/or your IDE**: Sometimes a fresh start resolves connection issues
- **Update to the latest version of your IDE**: MCP support is actively being improved
- **Check IDE logs**: Look for any error messages related to MCP or the documentation server

### Documentation Not Found

- **Verify server name**: Make sure you're using the correct server name in your prompts
- **Check internet connection**: The MCP Docs Server needs internet access to fetch documentation
- **Try specific questions**: Instead of general queries, ask about specific AgentOps features

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific**: Ask about specific AgentOps features, decorators, or integrations
2. **Provide context**: Mention what you're trying to achieve with your agent system
3. **Ask for examples**: Request working code examples for your specific use case
4. **Reference the docs structure**: You can ask about specific sections like "quickstart", "integrations", or "decorators"
