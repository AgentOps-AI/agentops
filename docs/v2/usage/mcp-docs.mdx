# MCP Docs Server

The **Mintlify MCP Docs Server** gives you and your coding agents instant, programmatic access to every page in the AgentOps docs. It works in **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **VS Code**, **Zed**, **Claude Code**, or any other tool that speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

<Note>
Looking for the AgentOps API tools instead? See the <a href="/v2/usage/mcp-server">MCP Server</a> guide.
</Note>

## Installation

```bash
npx mint-mcp add agentops
```

Run the command above in any folder and your IDE will automatically register the docs server. No extra configuration required.

## How it works

When you (or your in-editor AI assistant) ask a question, the IDE sends a request to the MCP Docs Server. The server searches the AgentOps docs and returns the most relevant sections so the assistant can craft a precise answer.

> **Example prompt**
> "How do I record custom spans with the `@operation` decorator?"

## What you can ask

Here are a few ideas to get you started:

### Add features
- "Add a chat interface with streaming support to my app"
- "Instrument my agent with the `@trace` decorator"

### Ask about integrations
- "How do I integrate AgentOps with the Vercel AI SDK?"
- "Show me a working example for CrewAI"

### Debug or update existing code
- "My trace isn't showing spans—what could be wrong?"
- "How do I customize the styling of the Session Waterfall?"

If the answer lives in the docs, the server will find it.

## Common issues

### Server not starting
1. Ensure `npx` is installed and working.
2. Check for other MCP servers running on the same port.
3. Verify your configuration file syntax.
4. On Windows, confirm Node.js and npm are installed.

### Tool calls failing
1. Restart the MCP Docs Server and/or your IDE.
2. Update to the latest version of your IDE.
3. Confirm that the AgentOps docs server appears in your IDE’s list of MCP servers.
