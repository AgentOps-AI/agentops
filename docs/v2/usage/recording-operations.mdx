AgentOps makes it easy to track operations and interactions in your AI applications with minimal setup.

## Basic Setup

The simplest way to get started with AgentOps is to initialize it at the beginning of your application:

```python
import agentops

# Initialize AgentOps with your API key
agentops.init("your-api-key")
```

That's it! This single line of code will:
- Automatically create a session for tracking your application run
- Intercept and track all LLM calls to supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Record relevant metrics such as token counts, costs, and response times

You can also set a custom trace name during initialization:

```python
import agentops

# Initialize with custom trace name
agentops.init("your-api-key", trace_name="my-custom-workflow")
```

## Automatic Instrumentation

AgentOps automatically instruments calls to popular LLM providers without requiring any additional code:

```python
import agentops
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize AgentOps
agentops.init("your-api-key")

# Make LLM calls as usual - AgentOps will track them automatically
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
)
```

This works with many popular LLM providers including:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Google (Gemini)
- Cohere
- And more

## Advanced: Using Decorators for Detailed Instrumentation

For more detailed tracking, AgentOps provides decorators that allow you to explicitly instrument your code. This is optional but can provide more context in the dashboard.

### `@operation` Decorator

The `@operation` decorator helps track specific operations in your application:

```python
from agentops.sdk.decorators import operation

@operation
def process_data(data):
    # Process the data
    return result
```

### `@agent` Decorator

If you use agent classes, you can track them with the `@agent` decorator:

```python
from agentops.sdk.decorators import agent, operation

@agent
class ResearchAgent:
    @operation
    def search(self, query):
        # Implementation of search
        return f"Results for: {query}"

def research_workflow(topic):
    agent = ResearchAgent()
    results = agent.search(topic)
    return results
    
results = research_workflow("quantum computing")
```

### `@tool` Decorator

Track tool usage and costs with the `@tool` decorator. You can specify costs to get total cost tracking directly in your dashboard summary:

```python
from agentops.sdk.decorators import tool

@tool(cost=0.05)
def web_search(query):
    # Tool implementation
    return f"Search results for: {query}"

@tool
def calculator(expression):
    # Tool without cost tracking
    return eval(expression)
```

### `@trace` Decorator

Create custom traces to group related operations:

```python
from agentops.sdk.decorators import trace, agent, operation

@trace
def customer_service_workflow(customer_id):
    agent = ResearchAgent()
    results = agent.search(f"customer {customer_id}")
    return results
```

### Manual Trace Management

For more control over trace lifecycle, you can manage traces manually:

```python
import agentops

# Initialize without automatic session creation
agentops.init("your-api-key", auto_start_session=False)

# Start a trace manually
trace = agentops.start_trace("my-custom-trace")

# Your code here
# ...

# End the trace with a specific state
agentops.end_trace(trace, "Success")

# Or end all active traces
agentops.end_trace(end_state="Emergency_Shutdown")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Simple**: For most applications, just initializing AgentOps with `agentops.init()` is sufficient.

2. **Use Decorators Sparingly**: Only add decorators when you need more detailed tracking of specific operations.

3. **Meaningful Operation Names**: When using decorators, choose descriptive names to make them easier to identify in the dashboard.

4. **Cost Tracking**: Use the `@tool` decorator with cost parameters to track tool usage costs in your dashboard.

5. **Trace Management**: Use manual trace management when you need precise control over trace boundaries and states.
