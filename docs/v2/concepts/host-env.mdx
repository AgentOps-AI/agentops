## Collected Information

The following information is automatically collected:

- **Operating System**: The OS type and version (e.g., "Linux", "Windows", "macOS")
- **Python Version**: The version of Python being used
- **Hostname**: The name of the host machine (anonymized)
- **AgentOps SDK Version**: The version of the AgentOps SDK being used
- **Process ID**: The ID of the process running the agent

## Usage in Analytics

Host environment information enables:

- Identifying environment-specific issues
- Tracking performance across different platforms
- Ensuring compatibility with specific OS versions
- Monitoring SDK version adoption

## Privacy Considerations

AgentOps is designed with privacy in mind:

- No personally identifiable information is collected
- Hostnames are anonymized
- No network scanning or detailed system analysis is performed
- Only the minimum necessary information for debugging is gathered

## Disabling Host Environment Collection

If needed, you can disable host environment collection when initializing AgentOps:

```python
import agentops

# Disable host environment collection
agentops.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", env_data_opt_out=True)
```
