## Automatic Session Management

The simplest way to create and manage sessions is to use the `init` function with automatic session management:

```python
import agentops

# Initialize with automatic session creation (default)
agentops.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", tags=["production"])
```

This approach:
- Creates a session automatically when you initialize the SDK
- Tracks all events in the context of this session
- Manages the session throughout the lifecycle of your application

## Manual Session Creation

For more control, you can disable automatic session creation and start sessions manually:

```python
import agentops

# Initialize without auto-starting a session
agentops.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", auto_start_session=False)

# Later, manually start a session when needed
agentops.start_session(tags=["customer-query", "high-priority"])
```

Manual session management is useful when:
- You want to control exactly when session tracking begins
- You need to associate different sessions with different sets of tags
- Your application has distinct workflows that should be tracked separately

## Using the Session Decorator

As an alternative to the methods above, you can use the `@session` decorator to create a session for a specific function:

```python
from agentops.sdk.decorators import session

@session
def process_customer_data(customer_id):
    # This entire function execution will be tracked as a session
    return analyze_data(customer_id)
```

## Session State

Every session has an associated state that includes:

- **Session ID**: A unique identifier
- **Start Time**: When the session began
- **Tags**: Labels associated with the session
- **Events**: All events recorded during the session

This state is automatically managed by AgentOps and synchronized with the dashboard.

## Session Context

Sessions create a context for all event recording. When an event is recorded:

1. It's associated with the current active session
2. It's automatically included in the session's timeline
3. It inherits the session's tags for filtering and analysis

## Viewing Sessions in the Dashboard

The AgentOps dashboard provides several views for analyzing your sessions:

1. **Session List**: Overview of all sessions with filtering options
2. **Session Details**: In-depth view of a single session
3. **Timeline View**: Chronological display of all events in a session
4. **Tree View**: Hierarchical representation of agents, operations, and events
5. **Analytics**: Aggregated metrics across sessions

## Best Practices

- **Start sessions at logical boundaries** in your application workflow
- **Use descriptive session names** to easily identify them in the dashboard
- **Apply consistent tags** to group related sessions
- **Use fewer, longer sessions** rather than many short ones for better analysis
- **Use automatic session management** unless you have specific needs for manual control
