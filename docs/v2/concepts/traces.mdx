## Automatic Trace Management

The simplest way to create and manage traces is to use the `init` function with automatic trace creation:

```python
import agentops

# Initialize with automatic trace creation (default)
agentops.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", default_tags=["production"])
```

This approach:
- Creates a trace automatically when you initialize the SDK
- Tracks all events in the context of this trace
- Manages the trace throughout the lifecycle of your application

## Manual Trace Creation
For more control, you can disable automatic trace creation and start traces manually:

```python
import agentops

# Initialize without auto-starting a trace
agentops.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", auto_start_session=False)

# Later, manually start a trace when needed
trace_context = agentops.start_trace(
    trace_name="Customer Workflow", 
    tags=["customer-query", "high-priority"]
)

# End the trace when done
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state="Success")
```

Manual trace management is useful when:
- You want to control exactly when trace tracking begins
- You need to associate different traces with different sets of tags
- Your application has distinct workflows that should be tracked separately

## Using the Trace Decorator

You can use the `@trace` decorator to create a trace for a specific function:

```python
import agentops
from agentops.sdk.decorators import trace

@trace
def process_customer_data(customer_id):
    # This entire function execution will be tracked as a trace
    return analyze_data(customer_id)

# Or with custom parameters
@trace(name="data_processing", tags=["analytics"])
def analyze_user_behavior(user_data):
    return perform_analysis(user_data)
```

## Trace Context Manager

TraceContext objects support Python's context manager protocol, making it easy to manage trace lifecycles:

```python
import agentops

# Using trace context as a context manager
with agentops.start_trace("user_session", tags=["web"]) as trace:
    # All operations here are tracked within this trace
    process_user_request()
    # Trace automatically ends when exiting the context
    # Success/Error state is set based on whether exceptions occurred
```

## Trace States

Every trace has an associated state that indicates its completion status. AgentOps provides multiple ways to specify trace end states for flexibility and backward compatibility.

### AgentOps TraceState Enum (Recommended)

The recommended approach is to use the `TraceState` enum from AgentOps:

```python
from agentops import TraceState

# Available states
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state=TraceState.SUCCESS)  # Trace completed successfully
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state=TraceState.ERROR)    # Trace encountered an error
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state=TraceState.UNSET)    # Trace state is not determined
```

### OpenTelemetry StatusCode

For advanced users familiar with OpenTelemetry, you can use StatusCode directly:

```python
from opentelemetry.trace.status import StatusCode

agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state=StatusCode.OK)     # Same as TraceState.SUCCESS
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state=StatusCode.ERROR)  # Same as TraceState.ERROR
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state=StatusCode.UNSET)  # Same as TraceState.UNSET
```

### String Values

String values are also supported for convenience:

```python
# String representations
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state="Success")        # Maps to SUCCESS
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state="Error")          # Maps to ERROR  
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state="Indeterminate")  # Maps to UNSET
```

### State Mapping

All state representations map to the same underlying OpenTelemetry StatusCode:

| AgentOps TraceState | OpenTelemetry StatusCode | String Values | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `TraceState.SUCCESS` | `StatusCode.OK` | "Success" | Trace completed successfully |
| `TraceState.ERROR` | `StatusCode.ERROR` | "Error" | Trace encountered an error |
| `TraceState.UNSET` | `StatusCode.UNSET` | "Indeterminate" | Trace state is not determined |

### Default Behavior

If no end state is provided, the default is `TraceState.SUCCESS`:

```python
# These are equivalent
agentops.end_trace(trace_context)
agentops.end_trace(trace_context, end_state=TraceState.SUCCESS)
```

## Trace Attributes

Every trace collects comprehensive metadata to provide rich context for analysis. Trace attributes are automatically captured by AgentOps and fall into several categories:

### Core Trace Attributes

**Identity and Timing:**
- **Trace ID**: A unique identifier for the trace
- **Span ID**: Identifier for the root span of the trace
- **Start Time**: When the trace began
- **End Time**: When the trace completed (set automatically)
- **Duration**: Total execution time (calculated automatically)

**User-Defined Attributes:**
- **Trace Name**: Custom name provided when starting the trace
- **Tags**: Labels for filtering and grouping (list of strings or dictionary)
- **End State**: Success, error, or unset status

```python
# Tags can be provided as a list of strings or a dictionary
agentops.start_trace("my_trace", tags=["production", "experiment-a"])
agentops.start_trace("my_trace", tags={"environment": "prod", "version": "1.2.3"})
```

### Resource Attributes

AgentOps automatically captures system and environment information:

**Project and Service:**
- **Project ID**: AgentOps project identifier
- **Service Name**: Service name (defaults to "agentops")
- **Service Version**: Version of your service
- **Environment**: Deployment environment (dev, staging, prod)
- **SDK Version**: AgentOps SDK version being used

**Host System Information:**
- **Host Name**: Machine hostname
- **Host System**: Operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Host Version**: OS version details
- **Host Processor**: CPU architecture information
- **Host Machine**: Machine type identifier

**Performance Metrics:**
- **CPU Count**: Number of available CPU cores
- **CPU Percent**: CPU utilization at trace start
- **Memory Total**: Total system memory
- **Memory Available**: Available system memory
- **Memory Used**: Currently used memory
- **Memory Percent**: Memory utilization percentage

**Dependencies:**
- **Imported Libraries**: List of Python packages imported in your environment

### Span Hierarchy

**Nested Operations:**
- **Spans**: All spans (operations, agents, tools, workflows) recorded during the trace
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Hierarchical structure of operations
- **Span Kinds**: Types of operations (agents, tools, workflows, tasks)

### Accessing Trace Attributes

While most attributes are automatically captured, you can access trace information programmatically:

```python
import agentops

# Start a trace and get the context
trace_context = agentops.start_trace("my_workflow", tags={"version": "1.0"})

# Access trace information
trace_id = trace_context.span.get_span_context().trace_id
span_id = trace_context.span.get_span_context().span_id

print(f"Trace ID: {trace_id}")
print(f"Span ID: {span_id}")

# End the trace
agentops.end_trace(trace_context)
```

### Custom Attributes

You can add custom attributes to spans within your trace:

```python
import agentops

with agentops.start_trace("custom_workflow") as trace:
    # Add custom attributes to the current span
    trace.span.set_attribute("custom.workflow.step", "data_processing")
    trace.span.set_attribute("custom.batch.size", 100)
    trace.span.set_attribute("custom.user.id", "user_123")
    
    # Your workflow logic here
    process_data()
```

### Attribute Naming Conventions

AgentOps follows OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for attribute naming:

- **AgentOps Specific**: `agentops.*` (e.g., `agentops.span.kind`)
- **GenAI Operations**: `gen_ai.*` (e.g., `gen_ai.request.model`)
- **System Resources**: Standard names (e.g., `host.name`, `service.name`)
- **Custom Attributes**: Use your own namespace (e.g., `myapp.user.id`)

## Trace Context

Traces create a context for all span recording. When a span is recorded:

1. It's associated with the current active trace
2. It's automatically included in the trace's timeline
3. It inherits the trace's tags for filtering and analysis

## Viewing Traces in the Dashboard

The AgentOps dashboard provides several views for analyzing your traces:

1. **Trace List**: Overview of all traces with filtering options
2. **Trace Details**: In-depth view of a single trace
3. **Timeline View**: Chronological display of all spans in a trace
4. **Tree View**: Hierarchical representation of agents, operations, and events
5. **Analytics**: Aggregated metrics across traces

## Best Practices

- **Start traces at logical boundaries** in your application workflow
- **Use descriptive trace names** to easily identify them in the dashboard
- **Apply consistent tags** to group related traces
- **Use fewer, longer traces** rather than many short ones for better analysis
- **Use automatic trace management** unless you have specific needs for manual control
- **Leverage context managers** for automatic trace lifecycle management
- **Set appropriate end states** to track success/failure rates
