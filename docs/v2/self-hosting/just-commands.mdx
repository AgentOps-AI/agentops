# Just Commands Reference

[Just](https://github.com/casey/just) is a command runner that provides convenient shortcuts for common development tasks. The AgentOps project includes a comprehensive `justfile` with commands for setup, development, testing, and deployment.

## Installation

First, install Just if you haven't already:

```bash
# macOS
brew install just

# Linux (using cargo)
cargo install just

# Or download from GitHub releases
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/bin
```

## Quick Reference

View all available commands:
```bash
just
# or
just --list
```

brew install just  # macOS
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make sure justfile is executable
chmod +x justfile

# Check file permissions
ls -la justfile
```

### Environment Issues
```bash
# Verify environment files exist
ls -la .env api/.env dashboard/.env.local

# Run setup to create missing files
just setup
```

### Docker Issues
```bash

# Restart Docker service
sudo systemctl restart docker  # Linux
```

## Custom Commands and Extensions

You can extend the `justfile` with your own commands. Add to the bottom of the file:

```bash
# Custom command example
my-command:
    @echo "Running my custom command"
    # Your commands here

# Command with parameters
deploy env:
    @echo "Deploying to {{env}}"
    # Deployment commands
```

Use custom commands:
```bash
just my-command
just deploy staging
```

## Best Practices

### Daily Development
