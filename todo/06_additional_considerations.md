# Additional Implementation Considerations for Immediate Span Export

## Overview
This document outlines additional considerations and implementation details for supporting immediate span export in the AgentOps v0.4 architecture.

## Why Immediate Span Export?

1. **Real-time Visibility**: Long-running operations like LLM calls or agent executions need to be visible in dashboards and monitoring tools as soon as they start, not just when they complete.

2. **Progress Tracking**: For complex workflows, seeing spans as they are created helps track progress and identify bottlenecks in real-time.

3. **Early Warning**: Immediate export allows for early detection of issues, even if the operation hasn't completed yet.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. ImmediateExportProcessor

The core of our implementation is the `ImmediateExportProcessor` class, which:

- Exports spans immediately when they start if they have the `export.immediate` attribute set to `true`
- Re-exports spans when they are updated via the `update()` method
- Exports spans again when they end to capture the complete span data

### 2. Span Update Mechanism

For long-running spans that need to show progress:

```python
# Example of updating a span in progress
with agent_span as span:
    # Start some long-running operation
    span.set_attribute("status", "Initializing model")
    span.update()  # Trigger immediate export with current attributes
    
    # Do some work...
    
    span.set_attribute("status", "Processing input")
    span.set_attribute("progress", 0.25)
    span.update()  # Trigger another export with updated attributes
    
    # More work...
    
    span.set_attribute("status", "Generating response")
    span.set_attribute("progress", 0.75)
    span.update()  # Another export
    
    # Final work...
    
    # The span will be exported one final time when the context manager exits
```

### 3. Default Settings for Different Span Types

We've set sensible defaults for immediate export based on the span type:

- **Session Spans**: `immediate_export=True` - Sessions are long-running and should be visible immediately
- **Agent Spans**: `immediate_export=True` - Agents are typically long-running operations
- **LLM Spans**: `immediate_export=True` - LLM calls can be long-running and should be visible immediately
- **Tool Spans**: `immediate_export=False` - Tools are typically short-lived, so immediate export is less important
- **Custom Spans**: `immediate_export=False` - Default to false, but can be enabled as needed

## Performance Considerations

1. **Export Frequency**: Excessive updates to spans can lead to performance issues. Use `update()` judiciously.

2. **Attribute Size**: Keep span attributes reasonably sized, especially for spans that will be exported multiple times.

3. **Batching**: The `ImmediateExportProcessor` exports spans individually, which can be less efficient than batching.
