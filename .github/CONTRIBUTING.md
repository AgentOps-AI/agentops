## Open Source and Proprietary Components

The AgentOps SDK is open source, but the backend and UI are not. We are source available and also support on-prem/VPC hosting upon request.

That said, we love when community members contribute to our open source SDK-- we even mail over swag packs to developers who help out :)

## Contribution Guidelines

We use issues primarily to communicate our thoughts and plans to the community. However, not every issue is suitable for the open-source distribution, as some features may depend on non-open-source parts of our stack.

When looking for issues to work on look for following tags:
- `good first issue`
- `help wanted`

If you have feature requests or bug reports, please open an issue.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to contribute is to start a conversation with us. We highly recommend:

1. Joining our Discord community
2. Sending us a message through our contact form at [agentops.ai/contact](https://agentops.ai/contact)

We look forward to collaborating with you and appreciate your interest in improving AgentOps!
