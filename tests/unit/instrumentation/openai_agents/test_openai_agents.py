Tests for OpenAI Agents SDK Instrumentation

This module contains tests for properly handling and serializing data from the OpenAI Agents SDK.
It verifies that our instrumentation correctly captures and instruments agent runs, tool usage,
and other operations specific to the OpenAI Agents SDK.

NOTE: All tests must define expected_attributes dictionaries to validate response data in spans.
This helps ensure consistent attribute structure for downstream OpenTelemetry consumers.

The Agents SDK has its own unique structure with:
- Agent runs with specific attributes and properties
- Tool calls and agent handoffs
- Raw responses that may contain either ChatCompletion or Response API objects
