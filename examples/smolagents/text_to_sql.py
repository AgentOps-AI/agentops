# # Text-to-SQL
#
# In this tutorial, we’ll see how to implement an agent that leverages SQL using `smolagents`.
# > Let’s start with the golden question: why not keep it simple and use a standard text-to-SQL pipeline?
#
# A standard text-to-sql pipeline is brittle, since the generated SQL query can be incorrect. Even worse, the query could be incorrect, but not raise an error, instead giving some incorrect/useless outputs without raising an alarm.
#
# Instead, an agent system is able to critically inspect outputs and decide if the query needs to be changed or not, thus giving it a huge performance boost.
#
# Let’s build this agent!
# ## Installation
# We will install the necessary packages for this example. We are going to use `sqlalchemy` to create a database and `smolagents` to build our agent. We will use `litellm` for LLM inference and `agentops` for observability.
# %pip install smolagents
# %pip install sqlalchemy
# %pip install agentops
