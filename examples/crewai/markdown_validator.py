# Next, we'll set our API keys. There are several ways to do this, the code below is just the most foolproof way for the purposes of this notebook. It accounts for both users who use environment variables and those who just want to set the API Key here in this notebook.
# [Get an AgentOps API key](https://agentops.ai/settings/projects)
# 1. Create an environment variable in a .env file or other method. By default, the AgentOps `init()` function will look for an environment variable named `AGENTOPS_API_KEY`. Or...
# 2. Replace `<your_agentops_key>` below and pass in the optional `api_key` parameter to the AgentOps `init(api_key=...)` function. Remember not to commit your API key to a public repo!
