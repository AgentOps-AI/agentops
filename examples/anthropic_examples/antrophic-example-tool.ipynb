Let\\'s break down why:\\n\\n1. Alignment with build focus: The Stealth Hacker is described as a \"stealthy and agile build focused on evasion.\" The Neofiber directly enhances both stealth and agility aspects of this build.\\n\\n2. Evasion increase: The +10% evasion increase is particularly valuable for a character that aims to avoid detection and enemy attacks. This will make it easier to sneak past enemy lines and escape if spotted.\\n\\n3. Movement speed bonus: The +5% movement speed bonus complements the build\\'s agility focus. Faster movement allows for quicker repositioning, easier escapes, and more efficient navigation through complex environments during covert operations.\\n\\n4. Synergy with hacking: While this cyberware doesn\\'t directly enhance hacking abilities, the improved evasion and speed will help the character get into optimal positions for hacking operations and quickly retreat if necessary.\\n\\n5. Non-interference with stealth: Unlike some combat-focused cyberware that might be noisy or visually obvious, this muscle fiber enhancement is subtle and won\\'t compromise the character\\'s ability to remain undetected.\\n\\n6. Correct corporation: The item is from Zetatech, which matches the requested corporation.\\n\\nOverall, the Neofiber cyberware enhances the core aspects of The Stealth Hacker build - stealth, agility, and evasion. It will allow the character to move more quickly and avoid detection more effectively, which is crucial for an infiltrator focused on covert operations. This cyberware provides a solid foundation for the build, leaving room for additional hacking-specific augmentations to round out the character\\'s capabilities.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=1385, output_tokens=408))\n"

      "Yes, the Neofiber cyberware from Zetatech is an excellent match for The Stealth Hacker build you described. Let's break down why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Alignment with build focus: The Stealth Hacker is described as a \"stealthy and agile build focused on evasion.\" The Neofiber directly enhances both stealth and agility aspects of this build.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Evasion increase: The +10% evasion increase is particularly valuable for a character that aims to avoid detection and enemy attacks. This will make it easier to sneak past enemy lines and escape if spotted.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Movement speed bonus: The +5% movement speed bonus complements the build's agility focus. Faster movement allows for quicker repositioning, easier escapes, and more efficient navigation through complex environments during covert operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Synergy with hacking: While this cyberware doesn't directly enhance hacking abilities, the improved evasion and speed will help the character get into optimal positions for hacking operations and quickly retreat if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Non-interference with stealth: Unlike some combat-focused cyberware that might be noisy or visually obvious, this muscle fiber enhancement is subtle and won't compromise the character's ability to remain undetected.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Correct corporation: The item is from Zetatech, which matches the requested corporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the Neofiber cyberware enhances the core aspects of The Stealth Hacker build - stealth, agility, and evasion. It will allow the character to move more quickly and avoid detection more effectively, which is crucial for an infiltrator focused on covert operations. This cyberware provides a solid foundation for the build, leaving room for additional hacking-specific augmentations to round out the character's capabilities.\n"
