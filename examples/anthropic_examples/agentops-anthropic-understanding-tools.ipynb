      "1. Cacodemon (Highest Priority):\n",
      "   - Weapon: Rocket Launcher with Lock-On Burst mod\n",
      "   - Strategy: The Cacodemon's aerial mobility makes it a priority target. Use the Rocket Launcher's Lock-On Burst to ensure hits. Aim for its open mouth, which is its weak point. A well-placed rocket in its mouth can stagger it, allowing for a quick Glory Kill.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Mancubus:\n",
      "   - Weapon: BFG 9000\n",
      "   - Strategy: The Mancubus is slow but dangerous due to its high firepower. Use the BFG 9000 to deal massive damage quickly. Aim for its arm cannons to disable its primary attack method. The BFG's area effect can also damage nearby demons.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Hell Knights (3 present):\n",
      "   - Weapon: Super Shotgun with Meat Hook\n",
      "   - Strategy: Use the Meat Hook to close distance quickly, then unleash the Super Shotgun's devastating close-range damage. Aim for the head to maximize damage. The Ice Bomb can be used to freeze multiple Hell Knights at once, allowing for easier targeting and potential Glory Kills.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Imps (Lowest Priority):\n",
      "   - Weapon: Super Shotgun or Rocket Launcher (for groups)\n",
      "   - Strategy: Imps are fast but relatively weak. Use the Super Shotgun for close encounters or the Rocket Launcher to take out groups. Their agility makes them dangerous if ignored, so eliminate them when they group up or after dealing with bigger threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Combat Tips:\n",
      "1. Use the Ice Bomb strategically to freeze multiple enemies, especially when Hell Knights and Imps are grouped together.\n",
      "2. Keep moving to avoid being surrounded. Use the Meat Hook on the Super Shotgun for quick mobility between targets.\n",
      "3. Save the BFG 9000 ammo for the Mancubus or if you get overwhelmed by multiple heavy demons.\n",
