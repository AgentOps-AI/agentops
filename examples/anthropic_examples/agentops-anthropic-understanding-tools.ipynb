Initial Crowd Control:\nStart by using the Ice Bomb to freeze as many demons as possible, particularly targeting the group of Hell Knights and the Mancubus. This will temporarily immobilize them and make them more vulnerable to attacks.\n\n2. Priority Target - Mancubus:\nThe Mancubus should be your first priority due to its high damage output and area denial capabilities.\nWeapon: Rocket Launcher\nStrategy: Use the Lock-On Burst mod (if available) to quickly dispatch the Mancubus while it's frozen. Aim for its arm cannons as they are typically weak points.\n\n3. Hell Knights (x3):\nNext, focus on the Hell Knights as they pose the greatest physical threat when they unfreeze.\nWeapon: Super Shotgun\nStrategy: Use the Meat Hook attachment to quickly close the distance and deliver devastating point-blank shots. Aim for their heads or exposed body parts for maximum damage. The Super Shotgun's high damage output is perfect for their tough hides.\n\n4. Imps (x2):\nClean up the remaining Imps last, as they are the least threatening in this group.\nWeapon: Super Shotgun\nStrategy: Their agility makes them tricky targets, but the Super Shotgun's spread will make it easier to hit them. Use quick, mobile shots to take them down efficiently.\n\nGeneral tips:\n1. Utilize the Meat Hook attachment on the Super Shotgun for rapid repositioning between targets.\n2. Keep moving to avoid being cornered by the Hell Knights once they unfreeze.\n3. Use Glory Kills whenever possible to replenish health and create momentary invulnerability frames.\n4. If enemies group up again, don't hesitate to use another Ice Bomb or Rocket Launcher shot for area damage.\n5. Be aware of the Imps' ability to climb walls and attack from unexpected angles.\n\nRemember, the key to success is maintaining mobility, prioritizing threats, and making efficient use of your powerful arsenal. Good luck, Doom Slayer!\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"End the session","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"agentops.end_session(\"Success\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
