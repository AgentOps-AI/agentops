Its porcelain face, cracked and weathered, reflected the emptiness that hung in the air like a lingering fog. The doll's painted eyes, now chipped and dull, stared into the distance, searching for something—anything—that still held life. It had once belonged to a child who dreamt of endless adventures, of castles in the clouds and whispered secrets under starry skies. But those dreams had long since crumbled to dust, leaving behind nothing but a hollow world where even hope dared not tread. The doll, a relic of a life that had faded, trudged through the darkness, its tiny feet stumbling over broken wishes and forgotten stories. Each step took more effort than the last, as if the world itself pulled at the doll's limbs, weary and bitter. It reached a place where the ground fell away into an abyss of despair, the edge crumbling under its weight. The doll paused, teetering on the brink. It reached out, as though to catch a fading dream, but there was nothing left to hold onto. With a faint crack, its brittle body gave way, and the doll tumbled silently into the void. And so, in a world where dreams had died, the foolish little doll met its end. There were no tears, no mourning.
