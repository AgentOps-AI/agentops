# Anthropic and AgentOps

AgentOps supports Anthropic's API for conversing with their LLM backend!

To start, learn more about Antropic [here!](https://www.anthropic.com)
If you want to get down to the gritty details, look [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/welcome) for their documentation.


> [!NOTE]
> If it's your first time developing for an LLM, be sure to look at our intro to LLMs (coming soon)! Here, we explain generic functions such as giving the AI a memory to exploring novel concepts like summarizing chunks at regular intervals to keep some context while saving memory!

## Getting Started

You can get Anthropic's API working with a few lines of code!

### 1. Import agentops and anthropic to your environment

```python
pip install agentops
pip install anthropic
```

### 2. Setup import statements

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic, AsyncAnthropic
import agentops
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

### 3. Set your API keys

```python
load_dotenv()
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY") or "<your_anthropic_key>"
AGENTOPS_API_KEY = os.getenv("AGENTOPS_API_KEY") or "<your_agentops_key>"
```

From here, you have a number of ways you can interact with the Anthropic API!

## Examples

> [!NOTE]
> You can download these journals directly and try them on Google Colab or Kaggle!


> [!WARNING]
> Remember; you need to set an API key for both Agentops and Anthropic!


## Sync Example; Nier Storyteller

In this example, we generate a sentence from three parts before having Anthropic generate a short story based off it!

## Async Example; Titan Support Protocol

In this example, we generate a script line for a mech based on it's health and the type. At the same time, we generate 4 UUIDs. We finally wait for both functions to finish before printing them for the user.

## Tool Example; Cyberware

In this example, we have the LLM call a simulated tool which gives one random piece of Cyberware based on the user's requested company. From there, the AI tells the user if the cyberware is good for the user's intended purpose. (combatant, hacker, etc.).

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to use the tools system, please look at the journal below! This gives examples related to knowing when a tool was used, some practices for calling a function from an API and returning it among other things! Using it is NOT the same as the other examples!


## Tool Deepdive; VEGA Hell Combat System

In this example, we look at the tool system through a deeper dive; we will use our LLM assistant, VEGA, to get three missions from an API and determine which deserves priority. Then, we will send a number of enemies we want to scan for during combat while also getting our weapons inventory (using two tools at the same time). VEGA will tell us the bet way in which to combat these enemies through a combat strategy.

## Looking for a Barebones, Straight To The Point Journal?

This journal directly shows the bare basics on using Anthropic and AgentOps!

> This is mainly recommended for those adept at programming or those who already understand how AgentOps and LLM APIs generally work!
