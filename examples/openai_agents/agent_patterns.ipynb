    "# OpenAI Agents Patterns Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates various common agentic patterns using the Agents SDK and how one can observe them using the AgentOps platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: This notebook was edited using Claude MCP NotebookEdit tool!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through several key agent patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents as Tools** - Using agents as callable tools within other agents\n",
    "2. **Deterministic Flows** - Breaking down tasks into sequential steps\n",
    "3. **Forcing Tool Use** - Controlling when and how agents use tools\n",
    "4. **Input Guardrails** - Validating inputs before agent execution\n",
    "5. **LLM as a Judge** - Using LLMs to evaluate and improve outputs\n",
    "6. **Output Guardrails** - Validating outputs after agent execution\n",
    "7. **Parallelization** - Running multiple agents concurrently\n",
    "8. **Routing** - Directing requests to specialized agents\n",
    "9. **Streaming Guardrails** - Real-time validation during streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pattern demonstrates how AgentOps automatically tracks and monitors your agent interactions, providing valuable insights into performance, costs, and behavior."

    "\n",
    "The mental model for handoffs is that the new agent \"takes over\". It sees the previous conversation history, and owns the conversation from that point onwards. However, this is not the only way to use agents. You can also use agents as a tool - the tool agent goes off and runs on its own, and then returns the result to the original agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could model the translation task above as tool calls instead: rather than handing over to the language-specific agent, you could call the agent as a tool, and then use the result in the next step. This enables things like translating multiple languages at once.\n",

In this case, `tool_choice` is not set, because otherwise it would result in an infinite loop - the LLM would call the tool, the tool would run and send the results to the LLM, and that would repeat (because the model is forced to use a tool every time.)\n",
