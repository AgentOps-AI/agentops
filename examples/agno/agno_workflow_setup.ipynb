    "# Workflow Setup with Intelligent Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build custom workflows in Agno that can orchestrate complex agent interactions with performance optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Workflows?\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows are powerful abstractions that allow you to:\n",
    "- **Orchestrate** multiple agents and teams in complex patterns\n",
    "- **Maintain state** across multiple invocations\n",
    "- **Implement custom logic** like caching, routing, or validation\n",
    "- **Optimize performance** through intelligent design patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Caching?\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching is particularly valuable for AI agents because:\n",
    "- **Cost Reduction**: Avoid redundant API calls for identical queries\n",
    "- **Performance**: Instant responses for repeated questions\n",
    "- **Development**: Faster iteration during testing\n",
    "- **User Experience**: Immediate responses for common queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "This caching workflow pattern is ideal for:\n",
    "- **FAQ Systems**: Where users ask similar questions repeatedly\n",
    "- **Development/Testing**: To avoid API costs during iteration\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: For common inquiries with standard responses\n",
    "- **Documentation Assistants**: Where queries about specific topics repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have:\n",
    "- **AgentOps API key** from [AgentOps](https://agentops.ai)\n",
    "- **OpenAI API key** from [OpenAI](https://openai.com)\n",
    "\n",

    "3. **Agent Integration**: Embed agents as workflow attributes\n",
    "4. **Custom Logic**: Implement caching in the `run()` method\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",

    "1. **Check Cache**: Look for existing responses in session state\n",
    "2. **Cache Hit**: Return immediately without API call\n",
    "3. **Cache Miss**: Generate new response and cache it\n",
    "4. **Stream Support**: Maintain real-time response streaming\n"
