    "# Async Operations with Agno\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage asynchronous programming with Agno agents to execute multiple AI tasks concurrently, significantly improving performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation showcases:\n",
    "- **Agno** for creating and managing AI agents\n",
    "- **Asyncio** for concurrent task execution\n",
    "- **AgentOps** for monitoring and tracking AI operations\n",
    "\n",
    "By using async operations, you can run multiple AI queries simultaneously instead of waiting for each one to complete sequentially. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with I/O-bound operations like API calls to AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "- **AgentOps API key** from [AgentOps](https://agentops.ai)\n",
    "- **OpenAI API key** from [OpenAI](https://openai.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `.env` file in your project root with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "AGENTOPS_API_KEY=your_agentops_key_here\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here\n",

    "2. **Create multiple async tasks** that query the AI about different programming languages\n",
