# Basic Agents and Teams with Agno

This example demonstrates the fundamentals of creating AI agents and organizing them into collaborative teams using the Agno framework.

## Overview

In this example, you'll learn how to:
- **Create specialized AI agents** with specific roles and expertise
- **Organize agents into teams** for collaborative problem-solving
- **Use coordination modes** for effective agent communication
- **Monitor agent interactions** with AgentOps integration

## Key Concepts

### Agents
Individual AI entities with specific roles and capabilities. Each agent can be assigned a particular area of expertise, making them specialists in their domain.

### Teams
Collections of agents that work together to solve complex tasks. Teams can coordinate their responses, share information, and delegate tasks based on each agent's expertise.

### Coordination Modes
Different strategies for how agents within a team interact and collaborate. The "coordinate" mode enables intelligent task routing and information sharing.
