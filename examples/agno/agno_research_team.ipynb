    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this advanced example, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- **Create specialized research agents** with domain-specific tools\n",
    "- **Build collaborative teams** that discuss and reach consensus\n",
    "- **Integrate multiple research tools** (Google Search, HackerNews, Arxiv, DuckDuckGo)\n",
    "- **Enable real-time streaming** of agent discussions\n",
    "- **Monitor complex interactions** with AgentOps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research team consists of four specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reddit Researcher** - Community insights and user experiences\n",
    "2. **HackerNews Researcher** - Technical discussions and industry trends\n",
    "3. **Academic Researcher** - Scholarly papers and evidence-based research\n",
    "4. **Twitter Researcher** - Real-time trends and public sentiment\n",
