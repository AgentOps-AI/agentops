    "Collaborative Research Team with Agno\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to create a sophisticated research team with multiple specialized agents,\n",
    "each equipped with different tools and expertise. The team collaborates to research topics from\n",
    "multiple perspectives, providing comprehensive insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This example creates a research team consisting of four specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reddit Researcher**\n",
    "   - Focus: Community discussions and user experiences\n",
    "   - Tools: Google Search (to find Reddit discussions)\n",
    "   - Expertise: Analyzing user opinions, practical advice, and real-world experiences\n",
    "   - Role: Provides insights from community perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HackerNews Researcher**\n",
    "   - Focus: Technical discussions and industry trends\n",
    "   - Tools: HackerNews API\n",
    "   - Expertise: Technical analysis and industry insights\n",
    "   - Role: Provides technical and startup ecosystem perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Academic Paper Researcher**\n",
    "   - Focus: Scholarly research and evidence-based findings\n",
    "   - Tools: Google Search + Arxiv API\n",
    "   - Expertise: Academic literature and research methodology\n",
    "   - Role: Provides evidence-based academic insights\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Twitter Researcher**\n",
    "   - Focus: Real-time trends and public sentiment\n",
    "   - Tools: DuckDuckGo Search\n",
    "   - Expertise: Current events and public opinion\n",
    "   - Role: Provides real-time social media insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Collaboration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mode: Collaborative discussion\n",
    "- Coordination: Team uses GPT-4 for discussion management\n",
    "- Process: \n",
    "  1. Each agent researches independently using their tools\n",
    "  2. Agents share findings and discuss implications\n",
    "  3. Team works towards consensus through structured discussion\n",
    "  4. Discussion continues until comprehensive understanding is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features Demonstrated:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating specialized agents with specific research tools\n",
    "- Building collaborative teams that discuss and reach consensus\n",
    "- Using various research tools (Google Search, HackerNews, Arxiv, DuckDuckGo)\n",
    "- Enabling real-time streaming of agent discussions\n",
    "- Tracking agent interactions with AgentOps\n"
