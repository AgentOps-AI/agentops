# Async Operations with Agno

This notebook demonstrates how to leverage asynchronous programming with Agno agents to execute multiple AI tasks concurrently, significantly improving performance and efficiency.

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates a practical example of concurrent AI operations where we:

1. **Initialize an Agno agent** with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model
2. **Create multiple async tasks** that query the AI about different programming languages
3. **Compare performance** between concurrent and sequential execution

By using async operations, you can run multiple AI queries simultaneously instead of waiting for each one to complete sequentially. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with I/O-bound operations like API calls to AI models.

    Demonstrate concurrent execution of multiple AI agent tasks.

    This function creates multiple async tasks that execute concurrently rather than sequentially.
    Each task makes an independent API call to the AI model, and asyncio.gather()
    waits for all tasks to complete before returning results.

    Performance benefit: Instead of 3 sequential calls taking ~90 seconds total,
    concurrent execution typically completes in ~30 seconds.
