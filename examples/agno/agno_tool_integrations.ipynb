        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrated several important concepts about tool integration in Agno:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Automatic Tool Usage**: Agents automatically determine when and how to use their available tools based on the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tool Selection**: When given multiple tools, agents intelligently select the most appropriate ones for the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Information Synthesis**: Agents can combine information from multiple tools to provide comprehensive responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **AgentOps Tracking**: All tool executions are automatically tracked by AgentOps, providing observability into:\n",
        "   - Which tools were used\n",
        "   - What parameters were passed\n",
        "   - Tool execution times\n",
        "   - Success/failure rates\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Specialized vs. General Agents**: You can create both specialized agents (with specific tools) and general-purpose agents (with multiple tools).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Viewing Results in AgentOps\n",
        "\n",
        "After running these examples, you can visit [AgentOps Dashboard](https://app.agentops.ai/) to see:\n",
        "- Detailed traces of each agent execution\n",
