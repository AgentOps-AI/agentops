    "# Basic Agents and Teams with Agno\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the fundamentals of creating AI agents and organizing them into collaborative teams using the Agno framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- **Create specialized AI agents** with specific roles and expertise\n",
    "- **Organize agents into teams** for collaborative problem-solving\n",
    "- **Use coordination modes** for effective agent communication\n",
    "- **Monitor agent interactions** with AgentOps integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agents\n",
    "Individual AI entities with specific roles and capabilities. Each agent can be assigned a particular area of expertise, making them specialists in their domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Teams\n",
    "Collections of agents that work together to solve complex tasks. Teams can coordinate their responses, share information, and delegate tasks based on each agent's expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordination Modes\n",
    "Different strategies for how agents within a team interact and collaborate. The \"coordinate\" mode enables intelligent task routing and information sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "- **AgentOps API key** from [AgentOps](https://agentops.ai)\n",
    "- **OpenAI API key** from [OpenAI](https://openai.com)\n",
