# ### Multi-Tool Orchestration with RAG approach using OpenAI's Responses API
#
# This cookbook guides you through building dynamic, multi-tool workflows using OpenAI's Responses API. It demonstrates how to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that intelligently routes user queries to the appropriate in-built or external tools. Whether your query calls for general knowledge or requires accessing specific internal context from a vector database (like Pinecone), this guide shows you how to integrate function calls, web searches in-built tool, and leverage document retrieval to generate accurate, context-aware responses.

# In this example we use a sample medical reasoning dataset from Hugging Face. We convert the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and merge the ‚ÄúQuestion‚Äù and ‚ÄúResponse‚Äù columns into a single string. This merged text is used for embedding and later stored as metadata.

# ### Create a Pinecone Index Based on the Dataset
# Use the dataset itself to determine the embedding dimensionality. For example, compute one embedding from the merged column and then create the index accordingly.

#
# *Pinecone Search Tool*: Allows the model to query a vector database using semantic search. This is especially useful for retrieving relevant documents‚Äîsuch as medical literature or other domain-specific content‚Äîthat have been stored in a vectorized format.

# # - A web search preview tool.

# As shown above, depending on the query, appropriate tool is invoked in order to determine the optimal response.

# For instance, looking at the third example, when the model triggers the tool named "PineconeSearchDocuments", the code calls‚ÄØ`query_pinecone_index`‚ÄØwith the current query and then extracts the best match (or an appropriate context) as the result. For non health related inqueries or queries where explicit internet search is asked, the code calls the‚ÄØweb_search_call‚ÄØfunction and for other queries, it may choose to not call any tool and rather provide a response based on the question under consideration.

# Here, we have seen  how to utilize OpenAI's Responses API to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with multi-tool calling capabilities. It showcases an example where the model selects the appropriate tool based on the input query: general questions may be handled by built-in tools such as web-search, while specific medical inquiries related to internal knowledge are addressed by retrieving context from a vector database (such as Pinecone) via function calls. Additonally, we have showcased how multiple tool calls can be sequentially combined to generate a final response based on our instructions provided to responses API. Happy coding!
