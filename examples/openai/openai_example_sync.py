# OpenAI Sync Example
#
# We are going to create a simple chatbot that creates stories based on a prompt. The chatbot will use the gpt-4o-mini LLM to generate the story using a user prompt.
#
# We will track the chatbot with AgentOps and see how it performs!
# First let's install the required packages
# # Install required dependencies
# %pip install agentops
# %pip install openai
# %pip install python-dotenv
# Then import them
from openai import OpenAI
import agentops
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Next, we'll grab our API keys. You can use dotenv like below or however else you like to load environment variables
load_dotenv()

os.environ["AGENTOPS_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("AGENTOPS_API_KEY", "your_api_key_here")

# Next we initialize the AgentOps client.
agentops.init(auto_start_session=True)

# And we are all set! Note the seesion url above. We will use it to track the chatbot.
