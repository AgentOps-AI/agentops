    "## Observing Responses API with AgentOps\n",
    "\n",
    "The Responses API is a new API that focuses on greater simplicity and greater expressivity when using our APIs. It is designed for multiple tools, multiple turns, and multiple modalities — as opposed to current APIs, which either have these features bolted onto an API designed primarily for text in and out (chat completions) or need a lot bootstrapping to perform simple actions (assistants api).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I will show you a couple of new features that the Responses API has to offer and tie it all together at the end.\n",
    "`responses` solves for a number of user pain-points with our current set of APIs. During our time with the completions API, we found that folks wanted:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the ability to easily perform multi-turn model interactions in a single API call\n",
    "- to have access to our hosted tools (file_search, web_search, code_interpreter)\n",
    "- granular control over the context sent to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "As models start to develop longer running reasoning and thinking capabilities, users will want an async-friendly and stateful primitive. Response solves for this. With AgentOps, we can easily observe the Responses API in action."
