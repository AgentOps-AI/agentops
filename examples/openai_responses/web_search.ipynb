    "## What is the Responses API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Responses API is a new API that focuses on greater simplicity and greater expressivity when using our APIs. It is designed for multiple tools, multiple turns, and multiple modalities ‚Äî as opposed to current APIs, which either have these features bolted onto an API designed primarily for text in and out (chat completions) or need a lot bootstrapping to perform simple actions (assistants api).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I will show you a couple of new features that the Responses API has to offer and tie it all together at the end.\n",
    "`responses` solves for a number of user painpoints with our current set of APIs. During our time with the completions API, we found that folks wanted:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the ability to easily perform multi-turn model interactions in a single API call\n",
    "- to have access to our hosted tools (file_search, web_search, code_interpreter)\n",
    "- granular control over the context sent to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "As models start to develop longer running reasoning and thinking capabilities, users will want an async-friendly and stateful primitive. Response solves for this. \n"
