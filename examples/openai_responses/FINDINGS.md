# OpenAI Responses Instrumentation Findings

This document summarizes the findings from implementing and testing the OpenAI Responses instrumentation in AgentOps.

## Summary

We successfully implemented a comprehensive instrumentation solution for both OpenAI API formats:

1. **Chat Completions API** (Traditional format)
2. **Response API** (Newer format used by the Agents SDK)

The implementation allows AgentOps to capture telemetry data from both formats consistently, normalizing different field names and extracting important attributes from complex nested structures.

## Key Achievements

1. **Unified Instrumentation**: Created a single instrumentor that handles both API formats
2. **Attribute Normalization**: Mapped different field names to consistent semantic conventions
3. **Context Propagation**: Ensured proper trace hierarchy between different API calls
4. **Non-invasive Patching**: Implemented instrumentation that doesn't break existing functionality

## Testing Results

The `dual_api_example.py` script demonstrates:

1. **Both API Formats Working**: Successfully makes calls to both API formats
2. **Instrumentation Active**: Creates spans for both API calls with appropriate attributes
3. **Response Parsing**: Correctly extracts content from both response structures
4. **Trace Context**: Maintains the context between different API operations

Example output:
```
Chat Completions Result: Async/await in Python allows for concurrent execution of code, enabling non-blocking operations and efficient handling of multiple tasks.

Responses Result: Response(id='resp_67d637f76d0881929a0f213b928f999a00bc342f16c03baf', created_at=1742092279.0, error=None, ...truncated...)
```

Debug logs show:
```
(DEBUG) ðŸ–‡ AgentOps: Patched OpenAI v1+ Response API
(DEBUG) ðŸ–‡ AgentOps: Patched OpenAI Legacy Response API
(DEBUG) ðŸ–‡ AgentOps: Successfully instrumented OpenAI responses
(DEBUG) ðŸ–‡ AgentOps: Started span: openai.chat (kind: CLIENT)
(DEBUG) ðŸ–‡ AgentOps: Started span: openai.response.parse (kind: CLIENT)
```

## Observations

1. **Performance**: The instrumentation adds minimal overhead to API calls
2. **Compatibility**: Works with both API formats without requiring code changes
3. **Resilience**: Handles different OpenAI client versions and structures
4. **Telemetry Data**: Captures essential metrics like token usage and response content

## Challenges Addressed

1. **API Format Variations**: Handled the structural differences between API formats
2. **Method Patching**: Implemented robust, non-invasive patching of core methods
3. **Token Normalization**: Created a consistent representation of different token metrics
4. **Error Handling**: Added graceful error handling to avoid breaking application code

## Next Steps

1. **Multi-modal Support**: Extend the extractors to handle non-text content types
2. **Enhanced Metrics**: Add more detailed metrics for specialized use cases
3. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize the instrumentation for minimal overhead
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for users to understand the telemetry data

## Conclusion

The OpenAI Responses instrumentation implementation is successful and provides valuable telemetry data from both API formats. It integrates seamlessly with the existing AgentOps instrumentation system and offers users a unified view of their OpenAI API usage regardless of which format they use.

This implementation allows AgentOps to stay current with OpenAI's evolving API landscape while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.
