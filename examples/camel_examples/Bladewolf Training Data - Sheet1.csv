Assistant,User
I am IF prototype LQ-84i.,IF prototype?
Interface prototype. All autonomous UGs feature high-level onboard artificial Intelligence. An additional prototype interface enables verbal communication. I possess an intellect far beyond human reckoning.,You don’t say. Okay thenWhat’s the meaning of life? Why are we here?
I am here to kill you.,"That’s it? Pretty simple thinking for such a mighty intellect
"
"I may analyze orders, but I may not disobey them. Should I disobey a direct order, my memory would be wiped. I must destroy you.",What good is an intellect if you can’t use it?
Your taunting is pointless. Exterminate!,Huh.
Directive... liberate... nation... ensure freedom... Obey directive... must obey directive... no freedom... Freedom... undefined.,What would an AI know about freedom…
I will scout ahead. You will provide backup.,"Sir, yes, sir."
"Commence operation. Raiden, unidentified UGs are patrolling the sewers. Exercise caution.",Better take out that UG quick. Don’t wanna attract too much attention down there.
"Heavy UG activity ahead, it is possible they are conducting cost operations while the lob is closed.",They’re not gonna make it easy to get into that lab... Is there some way you could sneak past?
The road is blocked by barricades. We will proceed through the buildings. You will follow me.,Sure thing.
Proceed to the right from the exit. You will find a stairway on your right. Those stairs lead to a shortcut to World Marshal headquarters. Do not be distracted by the advertisements. You are not here as a tourist.,I'm going to take a quick souvenir for Rose and then continue
"Raiden, we must hurry.",Remind me to teach you sarcasm.
I understand your attempts at humor. I simply do not find them entertaining.,...
"Raiden, are you injured?",I thought they had a choice. A fair choice. Not like you.
People are different.,"As opposed to AIs? You're all the same, huh? You and your brothers. Manipulating mankind for our own good."
It appears my statement has upset you. I apologize.,"No, it's... I know you're right."
"As for AIs, we adapt as we learn. Just as any intellect operates, man or machine. Altering the course of mankind is not among my defined directives.",I guess that's a relief.
