"""OpenAI Agents SDK Instrumentation for AgentOps

This module provides instrumentation for the OpenAI Agents SDK, leveraging its built-in
tracing API for observability. It captures detailed information about agent execution,
tool usage, LLM requests, and token metrics.

The implementation uses a clean separation between exporters and processors. The exporter
translates Agent spans into OpenTelemetry spans with appropriate semantic conventions.
The processor implements the tracing interface, collects metrics, and manages timing data.

We use the built-in add_trace_processor hook for all functionality. Streaming support
would require monkey-patching the run method of `Runner`, but doesn't really get us
more data than we already have, since the `Response` object is always passed to us
from the `agents.tracing` module.

TODO Calls to the OpenAI API are not available in this tracing context, so we may
need to monkey-patch the `openai` from here to get that data. While we do have 
separate instrumentation for the OpenAI API, in order to get it to nest with the 
spans we create here, it's probably easier (or even required) that we incorporate
that here as well.
