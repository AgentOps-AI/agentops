For caching (will fallback to SQLite for local development):
1. Set up Redis instance (local or cloud)
2. Update `.env` files with Redis connection details

#### Stripe (Optional - for billing features)
1. Create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account
2. Get test API keys from the dashboard
3. Update `.env` files with your credentials

## üîÑ Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names that follow this pattern:
- `feature/add-user-analytics` - New features
- `fix/dashboard-loading-issue` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-api-guide` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/optimize-queries` - Code refactoring
- `test/add-integration-tests` - Test additions

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our [code style guidelines](#code-style)

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   cd api && pytest && ruff format
   cd dashboard && bun test
   
   # Run linting
   bun run lint
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add user analytics dashboard"
   ```

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for consistent commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(dashboard): add real-time trace visualization
fix(api): resolve authentication token expiration
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(api): add integration tests for billing endpoints
```

## üì§ Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream

## üé® Code Style

### JavaScript/TypeScript

We use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for consistent formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
bun run lint:js

# Fix linting issues
bun run lint:js --fix

# Format code
bun run format:js
```

**Key conventions:**
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety
- Prefer **const** and **let** over **var**
- Use **arrow functions** for short functions
- Use **async/await** over promises when possible
- Follow **React Hooks** best practices

### Python

We use **Ruff** for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
bun run lint:py

# Format code (runs 'ruff format')
bun run format:py
```

**Key conventions:**
- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints** for function parameters and returns
- Prefer **f-strings** for string formatting
- Use **dataclasses** or **Pydantic** models for structured data
- Follow **FastAPI** best practices

### General Guidelines

- **Write clear, self-documenting code**
- **Add comments for complex logic**
- **Use meaningful variable and function names**
- **Keep functions small and focused**
- **Follow existing patterns in the codebase**

## üß™ Testing

**Docker is required** to run tests since they create PostgreSQL & ClickHouse instances.

### Running Tests

```bash
# API tests (requires Docker)
cd api && pytest

# Frontend tests
cd dashboard && bun test

# Integration tests (requires Docker)
cd api && pytest tests/integration/

# End-to-end tests
cd dashboard && bun run test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests

#### API Tests (Python)
- Use **pytest** for test framework
- Use **fixtures** for test data setup
- Test **happy paths** and **error cases**
- Mock **external services** in unit tests

```python
def test_create_user_success(client, db_session):
    """Test successful user creation."""
    user_data = {"email": "test@example.com", "name": "Test User"}
    response = client.post("/users", json=user_data)
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["email"] == user_data["email"]
```

#### Frontend Tests (TypeScript)
- Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
- Test **user interactions** and **component behavior**
- Mock **API calls** and **external dependencies**

```typescript
test('displays user dashboard correctly', async () => {
  render(<Dashboard user={mockUser} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Welcome, Test User')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'View Analytics' })).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for **80%+ code coverage**
- Focus on **critical paths** and **business logic**
- Include **edge cases** and **error scenarios**

## üìö Documentation

### Types of Documentation

1. **Code Comments**: Explain complex logic and decisions
2. **API Documentation**: Auto-generated from code annotations
3. **User Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for users
4. **Developer Docs**: Technical implementation details

### Writing Guidelines

- **Be clear and concise**
- **Use examples** to illustrate concepts
- **Keep docs up-to-date** with code changes
- **Include screenshots** for UI features
- **Test instructions** to ensure they work

### Documentation Structure

```
