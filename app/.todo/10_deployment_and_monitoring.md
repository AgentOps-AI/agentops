# Task: Deployment and Monitoring of v4 API

## Description

Create a deployment and monitoring strategy for the v4 API. This strategy should include deployment procedures, monitoring tools, and alerting mechanisms.

## Requirements

1. Create a deployment strategy for the v4 API
2. Set up monitoring for the v4 API
3. Set up alerting for the v4 API
4. Create a rollback strategy
5. Document the deployment and monitoring procedures

## Implementation Details

- Update the Dockerfile to include the v4 API
- Create deployment scripts
- Set up monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Set up alerting mechanisms (PagerDuty, Slack)
- Document the deployment and monitoring procedures

## Deployment Strategy

- Update the Dockerfile to include the v4 API
- Create deployment scripts for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Create a rollback strategy for failed deployments
- Document the deployment procedures

## Monitoring

- Set up Prometheus for metrics collection
- Set up Grafana for metrics visualization
- Create dashboards for key metrics:
  - Request rate
  - Error rate
  - Response time
  - Resource usage
- Document the monitoring procedures

## Alerting

- Set up alerting mechanisms (PagerDuty, Slack)
- Create alert rules for key metrics:
  - High error rate
  - Slow response time
  - Resource exhaustion
- Document the alerting procedures

## Performance Optimization

- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize query performance
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Scale resources as needed

## Documentation

- Document the deployment procedures
- Document the monitoring procedures
- Document the alerting procedures
- Document the rollback procedures
- Create runbooks for common issues

## Dependencies

- All v4 endpoint implementations
- Testing and validation

## Estimated Time

8-10 hours
