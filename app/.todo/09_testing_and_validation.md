# Task: Testing and Validation of v4 API

## Description

Create comprehensive tests for the v4 API endpoints. These tests should validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the endpoints.

## Requirements

1. Create unit tests for all v4 endpoints
2. Create integration tests for the v4 API
3. Create performance tests for the v4 API
4. Create validation tests for the v4 API
5. Create a test environment with sample data

## Test Types to Create

1. Unit tests for individual endpoint functions
2. Integration tests for the entire API
3. Performance tests for high-load scenarios
4. Validation tests for data consistency
5. Authentication tests for security

## Implementation Details

- Create test files in the `tests/api/v4` directory
- Use pytest for unit and integration tests
- Use locust or k6 for performance tests
- Create a test environment with sample data in Clickhouse

## Unit Tests

- Test each endpoint function in isolation
- Mock dependencies (Clickhouse client, authentication)
- Test error handling
- Test edge cases

## Integration Tests

- Test the entire API flow
- Test authentication
- Test data consistency across endpoints
- Test error handling

## Performance Tests

- Test endpoint performance under load
- Test query performance with large datasets
- Test concurrent requests
- Identify bottlenecks

## Validation Tests

- Validate data consistency between v2 and v4 endpoints
- Validate computed fields
- Validate response formats
- Validate error handling

## Test Environment

- Create a test environment with sample data in Clickhouse
- Create scripts to populate the test environment
- Create scripts to validate the test environment
- Document the test environment setup

## Dependencies

- All v4 endpoint implementations
- Clickhouse client implementation
- Authentication middleware

## Estimated Time

10-12 hours
