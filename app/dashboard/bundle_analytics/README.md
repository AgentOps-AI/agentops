# Bundle Analytics

This directory contains bundle analysis reports generated by running `npm run analyze`.

## How to Run Bundle Analysis

1. Run the analyze command:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

2. The analysis will be saved in a folder structure:

```
bundle_analytics/
  ├── branch-name/
  │   └── timestamp/
  │       ├── client.html
  │       ├── server.html
  │       └── edge.html
  └── README.md
```

3. Open the generated HTML files in your browser to view the bundle analysis.

## Understanding the Analysis

- `client.html`: Shows client-side bundle sizes and composition
- `server.html`: Shows server-side bundle sizes and composition
- `edge.html`: Shows edge runtime bundle sizes and composition

Use these reports to identify large dependencies and optimize your bundle sizes.
